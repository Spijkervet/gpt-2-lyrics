You wrote me you're coming
to tell you what you want.
Because someone else has taken my place.

I sat too long for you
that's why you didn't stay true to me.
But you forget how I got here.

But when you sit in front of me
then do not apply.
And don't cry, because you can't be serious.

Do you want to do one more thing?
When you come to me later.
Then don't forget to bring my kids.

What I haven't seen them for so long.
But know that they never spare their father.
And don't think they will say Daddy.
to your friend who has to lose it there.



What I've done with my kids before.
He cannot stand in my shadow in that.
I'm not mad that you took another one.
But always let my kids come to me.

But when you sit in front of me
then do not apply.
And don't cry, because you can't be serious.

Do you want to do one more thing?
When you come to me later.
Please take my children with you.

Just any square, just any bar
Just some wine, just confused
Just you sitting next to me
Ah just you, whom I adore so much

These are the most beautiful hours for me
That cannot last long enough for me
Don't say anything but just look at each other
Yes, really that's what I want to succumb to
I would like to give all my time for this
You don't know me yet you hear in my life
It might be a lot I would like
I only want to waste my time for you

refr .:
   Stay with me
   It would be too good if you asked me this now
   Do not go away
   After all, I will never get enough of you
   Stay with me
   It would be too good if you asked me this now
   Do not go away
   After all, I will never get enough of you



I don't even know your name yet you are with me
I'm rhyming a poem for you right now
And every day I am waiting for you
I already have sleepless nights from you

Don't know what to say
Or to explain
I close my eyes
I meet you

Me kroeggie is still open
Maybe there is still something to do there
Shall I walk on anyway?
But I want a drink, I have no dough
If I ask, I can pop something
Do I have money, I will come back
Was never a pain, so why not
Soon my worries will be over

refr .:
   I was a good customer
   Good for my money
   But my money is gone now
   To my sorrow
   No I don't have to knock on anyone's door now
   Because I am empty and no one sees me anymore
   But there could still be someone
   He says: hee gabber, that's nice
   Have a drink with me
   That would be nice



I look in through the window
That boy there was my best friend
And the girl he's holding
She made so much money from me
But I had been warned against it
Are you empty it is over
Shall I go in and ask
You pay me a drink now

refr. (2x) <|endoftext|> 
Forget everything I said
Forget what I did to you
You thought, he'll take my excuse again
You were wrong, this was the last time for me

I'll go before you persuade me
I'm going, I've now paid my toll
Remember you went very far with me
Now I am leaving, it is I who say, it is over

A tear, well I had thousands
You will be late now
Would you have made it clear to me once?
That you really love me
I had trusted you, now it's too late



I'll go before you persuade me
I'm going, I've now paid my toll

You are so wise, a child says
You are so gray, a child says that
You are married, says a child
You are old, that's what a child says

Then you think, yes one more wrinkle
you really become an old gentleman
But before you think, how should it be
She takes your hand and smiles at you



refr .:
   A child's smile
   Makes you realize you are alive
   A child's smile
   That still has a life ahead of it
   That life is worth living
   Sometimes with a bit of sadness
   But with love, happiness and fun ahead
   A child's smile
   That plays with a train or a doll
   A smile like that makes you happy
   No party can beat that
   What does it matter if you get older
   That doesn't matter anymore
   Because you feel happy
   Even if you have no money

You should know that I've come to care about you more than ever
I would never want to live with anyone else
You know I never talk but you should know this anyway
You should know that there is no one who can warm me like that
When you lie with me in my arms
I will never forget those moments
You should know when you said you really believed in me
And then you said yes to me
I'll never forget
You should know, it is so different living here with you
That is why I have given my word of faithfulness
I did that without regretting it
You are my happiness

Take me with you
Wherever you want to
Does not matter
As long as you're close to me
I live for you alone
You alone
Really know who I am
Only you, you are the sun to me when it rains
You are the woman of my dreams to me
Really you are

I still have that dream image that fascinates me so much
I saw the city of Jerusalem I was standing at the temple gate
The children's voices sang their jubilant song
Together with the angels to a heavenly melody
Together with the angels to a heavenly melody

Jerusalem Jerusalem open those gates again
Oh Sana to your king oh Sana to his glory

My dream face faded another image appeared
But without children's voices it was dark around me
All creations groan and on Kalvarich summit
The crucifix rose high in breathless silence
The crucifix rose high in breathless silence

Jerusalem Jerusalem gate to the angels voice
Oh Sana for your king oh Sana bless him



And after that came a new face that surpassed everything
The holy city rose again and renewed to the praise of God
The streets were pure gold and a rope through her horse
I saw the elect called to God's word
The sun no longer shone during the day, the moon no longer at night
For god himself was their very light, their glory and strength
For god himself was their very light their honesty and strength

Jerusalem Jerusalem sing in a joyful tone
Oh Sana to your king now forever before his throne
Oh Sana to your king now forever before his throne <|endoftext|> 
the day I saw you

and touched you
then you left

before I could say anything
you were gone again

in that one moment when I saw you

I'm waiting here

You did well,
but sometimes also done wrong
When I look back in time
a smile with tears,
that's how I feel today
Tasted of a life
So many friends unprecedented

With blood, sweat and tears
I said just fuck off here
With blood, sweat and tears
I said friends, goodbye friends the cake is finished

I was lucky
but also known grief
How often did I bump my head
but still, I am satisfied with all that I am
When your fame is over
you have to see who else you know

With blood, sweat and tears
I said just fuck off here
With blood, sweat and tears
I said friends, goodbye friends the cake is finished



I've really seen it
no, I'm not hungry
You don't stay crazy
that I will miss you later
I stay really alone, yes really alone
and no more nagging at my head
Well fuck off now

and what you left for me
I feel alone here so alone
but a tear doesn't help either ...

Goodbye my love, let me dream
the night is quiet you are away from me
Goodbye goodbye, one day I will come
where you are there is also room for me.
Now I'm sitting here the chill strikes
I want to go to you but I don't know how.
Show me the way, no one says
where do I go, where to .....

All my life I want to sing

As a girl still very small
Singing was so nice
Didn't understand what would happen yet
I often think back to this
Because I found my happiness
With all those songs I love so much
Now after years I am a privileged person
Every day I fulfill my greatest wish

All my life I want to sing
About joy and sorrow
Touching people with a beautiful melody
From a waltz to a tango
Call it the song of life
Because life is a big pot of pore
With music everything changes
Are the sounds from my heart
I realize that every hour of the day
It makes the tears disappear again
if things go wrong
it enchanted a smile all my life
see people often enjoying themselves
from Den Helder to Maastricht
oh, how glad I am to be able to sing



my life is unique
that's because of my audience
because together we share a beautiful feeling
it is that sentiment that everyone recognizes
love for music is what I mean
now after years I am a privileged person
every day I fulfill my greatest wish

All my life I want to sing
About joy and sorrow
Touching people with a beautiful melody
From a waltz to a tango
Call it the song of life
Because life is a big pot of pore
With music everything changes
"They are the sounds from my heart

Oh, I dreamed I was crazy
Just as crazy as at the time
Oh I dreamed that I saw you
And I got lost again
In your eyes, in your arms
And I bit into you
And I screamed that the world was
Just the way you wanted

Sprinkle the sand back in my eyes
Oh, Lucinde let me go
Oh, Lucinde let me walk
Along your legs to the moon

Yes, I knew then, this will pass
This flower only blooms overnight
But I felt in your body
That blindingly wild power
And my friend still stopped me
Because he knew: that girl is wrong
But I kissed my Lucinde
And the rest left me cold



Sprinkle the sand back in my eyes
Oh, Lucinde let me go
Oh, Lucinde let me walk
Along your legs to the moon
(Oh, Lucinde let me go)
Along your legs to the moon

(Oh, Lucinde)

O Lucinde where you are now
Actually none of my business anymore
Whether you have a fight with your husband
Or not even talk to him anymore
Or you break with a boyfriend
Whether it also cracks again
Whether you recover from a hangover
And then thinks: was that it?
Oh, Lucinde,
I won't forget you so easily

Sprinkle the sand back in my eyes
Oh, Lucinde let me go
Oh, Lucinde let me walk
Along your legs to the moon <|endoftext|> 
I lost my best friend

I walk the streets lonely
And the cold cuts through me
I can never talk to you again
Because you have left us
Forever alone
You who fought for a beautiful life
You who fought for your family
You who gave everything
I don't have to wait anymore
Because that makes no sense

I lost my best friend
But I can't forget you
If only I could hear you for a moment
What remains are words
Of pain and sorrow



I lost my best friend
Now you are far from us
You gave me so much beauty
Unfortunately it was only a moment
You had to go too early

I will always think of you
I cannot forget you
A friend for life
Even if only for a moment
A tear of grief
Forever in my thoughts
I think about my best friend
And very alone forever
Like you was only one
You didn't deserve this

I lost my best friend
But I can't forget you
If only I could hear you for a moment
What remains are words
Of pain and sorrow

The world has declared me bankrupt
I've never felt so good and light as now
I have never felt more clean and liberated than now
Get rid of the pubs, get out of the water
Gone are the hangovers, drunken blunders
Glassy mornings and worries, not to be paid

The world has declared me bankrupt
It is an astonishing fate that has bothered me
An astonishing conclusion to what once belonged to me
No parasites, no flattery
No more poaching, no more liberation
No more licking, it's over
Nothing more to get



The world has declared me bankrupt
It is a gift from God and not from society
It's a gift from God and this is what he said:
You have to work again, you have to sing again
You have to laugh again, you have to play again
You have to show and experience
You have to shine again

The way is clear
The way is open
The road is endlessly mine
Without luggage
Can I walk again
Because I'm an outlaw now

The world has declared me bankrupt
I have risen above the big squabble
I have transcended the crazy judgment
I have nothing left to lose
I only have to win
To love
To start
I can no longer be traced <|endoftext|>

For those with a fruitless search

The 1 who wants this,
Another wants that again,
So there is always something,
You never do it right
They tell you what to do
But I'm really fed up with that now.
Sometimes I don't want to today
And I have some sadness
Then you see people thinking, does she have what?
So if only that smile again,
Then they say oh again,
She may not have had her day

I do what I want,
I'm going my own way
Like I've always done
And what another says
Or what someone else thinks
I don't care about that,

no one laughs at me anymore,
no that's really over
I've had that time now,
I always kept quiet
but now do what I want
I feel "a lot better you know that?
no yesterday doesn't count anymore,
I guess I'll never come again
but that's a shame if you liked it,
I laugh at everything
then they go crazy,
I'm not laughing with anyone else

I do what I want,
I'm going my own way

Nothing is better than braving the cold with you
There are people who emigrate to warm countries
But we have no money in our cold hands
So we go to your parents in Zoutelande
In Zoutelande

What you tell me keeps me down to earth and warm
Above my head I see the gray clouds
I'm glad you're here
Glad you're here

We are here in the ramshackle beach house
I never cared where we were anyway
We drown ourselves in your father's drink
I'm glad you're here

Nothing is more beautiful than crossing the country with you
To have you with me in gloomy places
And to see that it is good
To see that we are bubbling
And with vodka and with bloating
Between rescue tires

He walked in town there
'Late at night
Suddenly across the street
He saw them
Someone shouted "you don't belong with us"
Knife, stab, pain

Think carefully about which side you are on

Stay - Black Water

The day was absolutely beautiful
I only remember
Little rain on your cheeks
Although that quickly disappeared inside
My god we danced until the morning
And we drank to the sun
Showed up again at the bottom
And then we turned around

Forget
To know nothing
Possessed
Swimming in black water

Bitten
Worn out
Unleash
Swimming in black water

There was nothing of value in the box
But I immediately remember
A thousand stories about things
And the sinking of a stone
Who dove after you singing
To the depth of the lake
Where you decided to stay
No more drifting this time

Forget
To know nothing
Possessed
Swimming in black water



Bitten
Worn out
Unleash
Swimming in black water

(intermezzo guitar)

Forget
To know nothing
Possessed
Swimming in black water

Bitten
Worn out
Unleash
Swimming in black water

I only remember
A little rain on your cheeks
I immediately resisted
Against endless desire
But I knew what it meant
For sooner and later
I just wanted again myself
To swimming in black water <|endoftext|> 
How are you
Pretty fool with your stories
Are you still scared?
Before the night

Do you still think they are you
Come and get it
Is your best friend
Still your bodyguard

The one behind your back
Speaks evil of you
And no conscience
Has more

Without a port
In the distance in sight
you will never find it like this again
The way back home

refr .:
    Tell me how does it feel
    On your throne of gold
    Tell me how does it feel
    Is there someone who loves you?
    Tell me how does it feel how does it feel
    How does that feel
    To be a Queen without a kingdom

Where are you going
So alone in the dark
Like a wallflower
During the night



With you painted
Scratched nails
Is there anyone who
gave a reason for this

Is there anyone when he
Knelt before your throne
Not feared
For his fate

Is there anyone who
Ever told you
That life is with you
Like a party in hell

All doors were open, you arrived
And everything was ready
We made the gestures you make
When someone is welcome
So welcome it almost hurts
Pain of being almost there

So beautiful, you were so beautiful, so beautiful
You could have been even more beautiful
But you couldn't
And we are always waiting for you

Wherever we walk in the world, you will continue to exist
We couldn't know you but we know who you are
And you remain someone who was welcome
So welcome it always hurts
Pain of being almost there

So beautiful, you were so beautiful, so beautiful
You could have been even more beautiful
But you couldn't
And we are always waiting for you

Your beautiful big eyes that would see the world
You held them tight
Maybe it is better this way, maybe ...

You were so beautiful, so beautiful
You were so beautiful, so beautiful
you could have become even more beautiful
but you couldn't
and we are always waiting for you

You were so beautiful



All doors are still open
You are coming <|endoftext|> 
I speak with fewer words
You say how quiet you are
I rarely leave my dreams
And you ask what I want
You shouldn't ask me anything
The answers are gone
What is there left to say
What still stands out

    When I drink I drink to you
    And when I think about you I think about you
    And if I lose then I lose you
    Then I lose you then I lose you

I live with my eyes open
And you talk in your sleep
It has come this far
We are a mirror to each other
Don't listen to me
Come hug me again
Let's talk without words
That says so much more



refr.

It is now or never
We grow old together
We will continue together
Hell heaven the dark
By the light
It is now or never
Even though I sometimes doubt you
even though I sometimes doubt myself
To life
Whether the earth revolves around the sun
But what can I do
What the hell can I say
I'm alone here
But
Think out loud

That when I drink I drink to you
And when I scream I scream for you
And when I dream then I dream of you
And if I fall then I fall into you
And when I long I long for you
And if I curse then I curse you
Because if I lose then I lose you
Then I lose you then I lose you <|endoftext|>

I have so much affection for you

There is so much love for you

I have such a relationship with you
I have so much friendship for you
And maybe this sounds a bit exaggerated
But I have those feelings for you



You don't ask for my motives
You just let me be
You understood me correctly
You heard me right
Because behind that proud exterior
Is so much love

Goodbye gloom
Goodbye melancholy
Welcome beauty
Welcome my love

Because behind that proud exterior
There is so much love for you

You know about fine words
I don't miss it otherwise
Because behind that proud exterior
There is so much love for you <|endoftext|> 
I always had
Love at hand
Never been alone
Only in thoughts

Fame is lonely
Everyone knows you
And leave you alone
But you are left behind
Empty-handed

But I always had
Love at hand
Lots of warmth
A lot of luck

I also have in my
Dug past
On the basis of someone
Someone who can know



Seeking
The painful places
Looking for the causes
Of my fears

But I always had
Love at hand
Lots of warmth
A lot of luck

Now I am liberated
And heal for a long time
This is the message
From a Sunday child

I check the clock
Slow, slow
The night passes
And it becomes light

But I always had
Love at hand
Lots of warmth
A lot of luck <|endoftext|> 
As far from home as possible
I feel good there
I feel good

My words are my company
And the sounds of the night

Then my mind wanders
In the eyes of a stranger

In the distant past

The loneliness of an unknown language
The beauty of new beginnings

And the heat the eternal warmth
The length of a long day

Lost the North
It will come back



Anyway
Anyway

That there is distance
That distance exists
And a return is possible
But for now I feel at home here
As far from home as possible
Not that I don't miss you
Not that I don't miss you
Not everything is understandable
Look what I see here now
Look what I see here now

An enchanting landscape
Soft faces

You asked where I was
And that you were doing better
No further news
From the East

Anyway
Anyway

That there is distance
That distance exists
And a return is possible
But for now I feel at home here
As far from home as possible
Not that I don't miss you
As far from home as possible
Not that I don't miss you
Not that I don't miss you <|endoftext|> 
Sing to me pretend you move
Mouth for me let me forget
Let it be a song for you
For the night
For sleeping
The hour has struck for you and me
Sing to me, sing to me

sing to me break the silence
Between you and me for once
cheat me
Let it be a song for you and me
A song of longing
A song of warmth
Like a kiss here on my cheeks
Sing to me, sing to me <|endoftext|> 
And she looked at the landscape, the rolling fields.
It is always so beautiful, you said yourself and she turned around.

She asked if I still had a contract with him, and how he was, where he lived, where he left off.
Old love ever passes, old love ever passes, ever passes.



And somewhere far away, behind the hills.
Fire breaks out, smoke reaches to the sky.
This was a desolate region, no one to be seen, and she looked at the landscape, rolling fields.

Does old love ever pass away, old love ever pass away, ever pass away?

Will old love ever pass away, ever pass away. <|endoftext|> 
In every beat of the wing
In every glass of water
And in the rain that I hear
In every coffee smell
In every morning air
And on every piece of paper

In the brightly colored lights of the big city
On the Polaroids on my door
In the darkness between the stars
And in every thought of mine

You are everywhere
You are everywhere I go
Every day every evening speaks only of you
When you're not there either
Are you always with me
Are you always with me

In every summer wind
And every labyrinth
Of my gray theories
In every blink of an eye
Every anniversary
And in every symphony
And when it gets warm again in autumn,
And when the snow is just passing
When I think I can't go on
Then I feel you stronger than ever



You are everywhere
You are everywhere I go
Every day every evening speaks only of you
When you're not there either
Are you always with me
Are you always with me

The others have long since disappeared
You never let me down
And if my way seems endless I know
You wait for me in the end

You are everywhere
You are everywhere I go
Every day every evening speaks only of you
When you're not there either
Are you always with me

You are everywhere I go
Every day every evening speaks only of you
When you're not there either
Are you always with me
Are you always with me
Are you always with me <|endoftext|> 
There you stand before me, so innocent and sweet ...
and when I look at you the same thoughts keep flashing through my head
I have no choice, I have to tell you!

Number 1 ... I would love to kiss you
Number 2 .. I slowly stroke your lips
Number 3 ... I don't want to just dance with you
Number 4 ... look deep into my eyes
Number 5 ... hold me all night
Number 6 ... I just want to be with you right now
But the biggest sin that is Number 7 .. (number 7)
Because tonight you are mine .. I'll take you home!

CHORUS:
You are worth seven sins
Seven sins saved for you
You are so special, much more than a miracle
I can't stand it that's why I say yes !!!!



Seven sins in 1 night
Seven sins when you smile at me
I want to float with you and experience everything
The sins of love are made for us

Number 1 ... we drink champagne together
Number 2 ... you make my heart beat faster
Number 3 ... and on my bed are red roses
Number 4 ... I want to feel your body
Number 5 ... lead you to my room
Number 6 .. and I whisper softly I love you
But the biggest sin that is Number 7 .. (number 7)
Because tonight you are mine .. I'll take you home!

REFRAIN 2X <|endoftext|> 
you make mistakes in life
many times you have forgiven me
I cheated on you you got mad
you walked down the street cursing
but deep in my heart I now feel that pain
I want to be with you forever

without you, my world is so cold
without you, I keep going wrong ..
it doesn't matter what I did to you
you always stayed true to me
I can only say I love you

if I saw you walking once
I was hoping over and over again
that you came back here with me
and we could be together
but deep in my heart
do I now feel that pain,
I wish I could always be with you




without you, my world is so cold
without you, I keep going wrong
it doesn't matter what I did to you
you always stayed true to me
I can only say I love you

it doesn't matter what I did to you
you always stayed true to me
I can only say I love you
I can't live on ........
WITHOUT YOU! <|endoftext|> 
After a while I know my own limits
I now know how much I can take
Still, every now and then I still want a little too fast
When I go I soon make my own plan
Because the night is mine as long as the tap is running
Even though I was still demolished days later
I'll see how I get home still haven't had enough
I am far from done in this pub
Find the way home or come back automatically
Don't wait for me, I'm not that quick

Once I sit, I sit out all night
Then sing along everywhere, not beautiful but loud
Because the night is mine as long as the tap is running
Even though I was still demolished days later
I'll see how I get home still haven't had enough
I am far from done in this pub
Find the way home or come back automatically
Don't wait for me, I'm not that quick



The whole world revolves around me for a moment
Keep the atmosphere going inside me
I'll see how I get home still haven't had enough
I am far from done in this pub
Find the way home or come back automatically
Don't wait for me, I'm not that quick <|endoftext|> 
the clouds are leaving the sun is shining
the light breaks through the golden horizon
this light also makes your pain disappear
and the grief that you overcame
in the distance music sounds good listen
then you become happy you get courage again

sing and laugh and indulge yourself
after all those tears you've cried
let yourself take care of tomorrow
now be happy
sing and laugh for you regret
because your life does not last forever
live today don't think about tomorrow
and give life a new chance



your path was by no means always smooth
life was often not good for you
sometimes you have chosen the wrong way
hope you find happiness now
in the distance music sounds good listen
then you become happy you get courage again

sing and laugh and indulge yourself
after all those tears you've cried
let yourself take care of tomorrow
now be happy
sing and laugh for you regret
because your life does not last forever
live today don't think about tomorrow
and give life a new chance

sing and laugh for you regret
because your life does not last forever
live today don't think about tomorrow

I'm in my hotel
am alone again as usual
stare ahead of me
through the window
far away from there
where I can share with her
love, i hate you, hence

Chorus:
but then my phone
always knows where I live
looking for you alone
sailing on the waves
floating through the clouds
I chase all my dreams
I blow past the trees
I will come to her
no one who can stop that
it is gold, gold
nothing to stop me
just to be with her



I just empty my glass
leave the night left
no one here waiting for me

Chorus:
but then my phone
he still knows where I live
looking for you alone
sailing on the waves
floating through the clouds
I chase all my dreams
I blow past the trees
I will come to her
no one who can stop that
it is gold, gold
nothing to stop me
to be with her,
to sail on the waves
float through the clouds
I chase all my dreams
I blow past the trees
I will come to her
no one who can stop that
it is gold, gold
nothing to stop me
just to be with her <|endoftext|> 
So quiet,
That everyone knows it stays that way
Forever, forever and a lifetime, it was
So quiet,
That everyone felt it in their body
No pen can ever describe this feeling again.

So quiet,
That all the bells were silent yeah
Time stood motionless,
So quiet and so lost you went away
You left so quiet and so lost.

I've heard so much and yet nothing touches me anymore
And that's why I can't sleep at night
Though I wrote a thousand songs about this loss,
Even then I wouldn't know
Why, this feeling is forever.

So hard,
The hours after the blow rumbled so after,
That nothing could still be understood and understood, it was,
So hard,
That everything we thought only brought us emptiness
We were so tired and so beaten
Now that the silence was with us instead of you.

I've heard so much and yet nothing touches me anymore
And that's why I can't sleep at night
Though I wrote a thousand songs about this loss,
Even then I wouldn't know
Why, this feeling is forever.



So quiet,
Though I still miss you every day
And wherever you may be now
Really it is,
Me bright,
That silence has now become your friend.

I've heard so much and yet nothing touches me anymore
And that's why I can't sleep at night
Though I wrote a thousand songs about this loss,
I really would not know,
I really would not know.

I've heard so much and yet nothing touches me anymore
And that's why I can't sleep at night
Though I wrote a thousand songs about this loss,
Even then I wouldn't know
Why, this feeling is forever. <|endoftext|> 
For seven nights
And nothing I do feels right
Seven nights of searching
But nothing but really matters
All beautiful words
All my words in your ear
That no one, I say no one
Heard of me before
Way too many promises
I put it aside
What now ?

Seven nights on the road
Looking for you for seven nights
Seven nights on the road
Looking for you for seven nights

For seven nights
And everything I see is skewed
Seven nights of boozing
And I hoped I stayed drunk
But I keep getting sober again
And I always remember where I am
I want to leave, but I can't leave
Although I really know the way
At every pub that closes
I invariably fall down
About you



Seven nights on the road
Looking for you for seven nights
Seven nights on the road
Looking for you for seven nights
Searching for you
Searching for you

Seven nights on the road
Looking for you for seven nights
Seven nights on the road
Looking for you for seven nights
Searching for you
Searching for you <|endoftext|> 
Now that the clock is no longer my friend
And the waiter rude
Because the man he serves
Another wrong lady met
Then no one can tell me
Why my heart still beats?
Why do I keep ordering?
Why don't I get up?

Because there is only one conclusion
She's not here
And I don't think she's coming
She's not here
And I wonder why
I don't just walk back home

The glass that disappears into the sink
The money ringing in my pocket
All sounds dislike me
I'm not comfortable here

Because there is only the conclusion
Well, she's not here
And I don't think she's coming
Well, she's not here
And I wonder why
I don't just walk back home



Because from under the table
Desire takes hold of me again
It flies to my throat
Makes me decide to get up
And run blind through the night
Don't ask me what I expect
Of so much despair in a man
But you can think of a woman

But she is not there
And I don't think she's coming
No, she's not here
And I wonder why
I don't just walk back home

No, she's not here
And I don't think she's coming
No, she's not here
And I wonder why
I don't just walk back home

xXx Me (= <|endoftext|> 
The most beautiful street corner
Smells like coffee and beer
I smoke a cigarette
And then another four or so
Her window is always open
She can see me like that
She calls out: Wait for me tonight
It's time to leave

I can never do better
Then such a beautiful impatience
Until I've looked down at the sun
Which does not make me regret
And when I pick her up
She sits next to me and she is silent
I drive faster than usual
Push the asphalt ahead of us

Saturday
I didn't do anything that is allowed later
Saturday
I saw the week that was in the water
But Saturday
Saturday
Am I freer than the rest



The city is behind us
We look at each other
It will never be the same again
We here, the world there
And I know what she's thinking now
We can't go back
Please drive on forever
Because everything, everything is going too fast

I slowly lived on
In the margin of such a day
That everything is just possible but not necessary anymore
And I wasted my time
But I'm ready for Saturday

Saturday
I didn't do anything that is allowed later
Saturday
I saw the week that was in the water
But Saturday
Saturday
Am I freer than the rest <|endoftext|> 
She's not a cure for the ticking of the clock
No hope
No guide
No port at night

No source in the desert when you are dying of thirst
Not the smile at your worst joke

She's not a hit chorus that sounds off the scaffolding.
Not the most expensive wine you drink without a hangover
Not a flower garden in bloom
Not one of a thousand nights
Not an outstretched hand
Not the end of all my waiting


No more than I actually want to admit
She makes the difference


She's not a lame excuse for what I would have liked to be
Not a dream
No purpose
Not a stick to hit with

No guarantee of a long happy life
It is not an answer to the question of our existence

Not the most beautiful symphony among the film called: We two
Not the clean cool bed that can take away my fevers
Not the beat of my heart
Not the clearest conscience
She didn't come at the right time
And I don't care either




Because even more than I want to admit
She makes the difference


Between everything I had and how it suddenly started to live
What is sketched in pencil can be drawn in color

Between never going on and experiencing everything
Between never and maybe very sometimes
And between me and us

So many songs, so many words
It must all be said
But whatever she tries
No comparison is right

Maybe it is a bit simple
But all I want to hear ... is
She makes the difference
she makes the difference


Because she's not a good conversation
What no dog is waiting for.
Not the flag I'm fighting under
No advice on all my complaints
Not the very last way out
Which we have not thought about for a long time


But even more than I want to admit
She makes the difference
she makes the difference
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Welcome to our midst

Welcome to this house

Now that you are finally here again

Welcome, boy

Welcome home



We were worried

We waited a long time

We never thought

That you could ever leave us.

But come to the table and tell us your stories

Wash your hands if you want



We slept badly for years

We wandered through the night

We didn't have the strength

To let you go forever

But come to the table and tell us your stories

Eat our bread and drink as much as you can



Welcome to our midst



Welcome to this house

Now that you are finally here again

Welcome, boy

Welcome home



Nobody ever left

Without anything like goodbye

We thought the northern sun

For us it didn't really exist

But welcome, boy

Welcome home



Come to the table and tell us your stories

Don't spare us for what you saw



Welcome to our midst

Welcome to this house

Now that you are finally here again

Welcome, boy

Welcome home <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes I still can't believe it
I fought and I surfaced
I learned that remaining is also an art
I had to promise myself
Not to show off or exaggerate
I know that staying humble is also a favor

But now I can't hold back
They can know that I win

Revenge on anyone who thought I couldn't do anything
I take
Revenge on anyone who always started without me

They say blessing comes from above
And that things just happen to us
While we dream something bigger to go to
I find it hard to believe
That no one can steer or emerge
From all the undercurrents in the ocean



Anyone see me?
Does anyone know that I'm here?
Anyone see me?
Is there anyone who recognizes my soul?

I take
Revenge on anyone who thought I couldn't do anything
I take
Revenge on anyone who always started without me
Revenge on anyone who kept me waiting and didn't come
Revenge on anyone who didn't take me seriously

Anyone see me?
Is there anyone who recognizes my soul?
I'm taking revenge
Anyone see me?
Does anyone know that I'm here?
Anyone see me?
Is there anyone who recognizes my soul?

I take
Revenge on anyone who thought I couldn't do anything
I take
Revenge on anyone who always won <|endoftext|> 
We stay where we are
dead silent, terrified
for what's to come
but the wait takes so long.
Even gravity changes
nothing to stop us anymore.

Because we could do anything
but we don't believe
that everything is really possible.
We don't believe in anything
We don't believe in anything.
That is why we are afraid.



We keep looking at the neighbors
from behind the curtain.
But what's to come
will always be different,
than we dare to hope.
Nothing to stop us anymore.

Because we could do anything
but we don't believe
that everything is really possible.
We don't believe in anything
We don't believe in anything.
That's why we're afraid
therefore we are afraid.

Because we could do anything
but we don't believe

We don't believe in anything

She buys her flowers herself
She hopes that spring will come by then
But deep down she knows
That they wither in an instant
That the water becomes cloudy
That they let their heads hang

The color of anything
Is buried underneath the smell of sunlight
And the moon that lies beneath
Hides the bitter truth
That drowning in a bed of blooms
Is better than the lies
That slide from singers and the songs that
Slip their teeth

At nightfall
He longs for a trail
Of a promise in her words
He knows that
And the days keep running
The calendar is a game
It takes some getting used to September
So soon

They look at each other
They make love with their eyes wide open
Than they ever did
It feels like hope to her
But she sees it for him
More of a matter of necessity through
The silence in her voice



All the summer's falling down
And the sun is on the ground
Falling upon a pile of photographs
And the days flame out
In the dark among the ashes
On this calendar go-round
I got older in September
And there's no way out

The trees are getting bare
(autumn is falling down, around)
His dreams leaf ahead
(the leaves are blowing eastward into town)
Like to the end of a story
Her warmth in vain
(all your life you had the things you lose)
His arms emptier than he can take now
(the things you keep, the things you wish
you'd never left behind)
He had it all once

At nightfall
All the summer's falling down
Her heart drags on
And her heart is on the ground
She wants to go back but continues
A breath of wind among the photographs
She knows that
And the days fade out
Did she ever get to know him?
In the dark among the endings
Were they together?
On this calendar go-round
It takes some getting used to September
Heading west into September

And the lights go down

And the lights go down
Way too early this year <|endoftext|> 
My foaming course
Now behind the helm
I don't really long for later
We made a lot of water
Through cracks and holes
I drew much more than I feed
I was looking for a safe haven
Deserted and well out of the wind
But who seeks and does not find
Asks for melancholy and thirst
And both are equally addictive
We are water makers
And we stay afloat
If we now our bodies
Let it rest together?
Or will we sink
Drowning ingloriously
In tears with which
We're not extinguishing the fire, are we?
We are water makers, my love
Watermakers
Take the old compass
Look how clear the glass
Not even a tear, not even a scratch from my remorse
I am myself enough
So much regrets ahead
Still, I feel better than I used to
I'm looking for an island in tears
My feet on your deep ground
Wash the salt from my wound
From a pure source
So open all taps to me
We are water makers
And we stay afloat
If we now our bodies
Let it rest together?
Or will we sink
Drowning ingloriously
In tears with which
We're not extinguishing the fire, are we?
We are water makers, my love
Watermakers <|endoftext|> 
Getting up was normal
Getting up was just getting up
It was normal to leave
To leave was just to leave
Leave and come back
Sooner or later
Coming back again
As it goes
But not forever

Because that leaving you
Hurts way too much
Should it be?
Or does it fall to us?
Does it belong to us?
That getting away from you
Feels like a punishment
Back to square one
Are we sad and tired
So sad and tired

Standing still was normal
Standing still was just standing still
Dying was normal
Dying was just dying
Dying and reviving
Sooner or later
Revive again
As it goes
But not forever

Because that leaving you
Hurts way too much
Should it be?
Or does it fall to us?
Does it belong to us?

So sad and tired <|endoftext|> 
You were alone for a long time
But I no longer wait
Until someone else comes to you

The nights are so quiet
Sometimes the ghost lingers there
I'll stay with you until the sun comes up
Hey!

Wide open, I'm standing
Wide open, I'm standing
Wide open waiting for you

Stop being afraid
Don't run away any longer
No, don't wait for you to come to me



This is a new morning
A blue with pink sky
I'll stay with you until the sun comes up
Hey!

Wide open, I'm standing
Wide open, I'm standing
Wide open waiting for you

Wide open, I'm standing
Wide open, I'm standing
Wide open waiting for you

Wide open, I'm standing
Wide open, I'm standing
Wide open, I'm standing

Wide open, I'm standing
Wide open, I'm standing
Wide open waiting for you <|endoftext|> 
Without saying anything
But with a great feeling
I close the door behind my thoughts
Without hoping for anything
Let me let things go
Let everything wait for me from now on

The clock chokes on my rhythm
The rhythm of my heart is wild and out of time

What a life, what a life!
And what to do with it?
It feels like waiting for a miracle
What a life, what a life!

Is it blush that I kiss you?
Or can I just no longer live without?

Sometimes we are strangers
Sometimes lovers of each other

Without nice words
But with a great feeling
You smile at me and you take control of my destiny
And without thinking
Do you know what I mean
I feel the holy fire ignite spontaneously



The clock chokes on my rhythm
The rhythm of my heart is wild and out of time

What a life, what a life!

I need not be ashamed
For what I've ever done
I don't have to explain anything
I know you heard me right

So many people who find something
So many opinions
As if I always need to know what you think
You decide what is bad and what is good
As if I always need to know what you think
You always know better how to do it

I don't have to prove anything
If it has already gone well
I don't have to erase anything
I know for whom it was not done

In the search for the beauty,
From unknown places,
Are there always the words,
And the sounds of longing,
Where the endless wisdom,
And the depth of the water,
Who connect us in time,
Earlier now and later,

On an endless journey far from mother, wife and child,
There is always a hiding place where I find my brothers in arms.
On an endless journey far from mother, wife and child,
There is always a hiding place where I find my brothers in arms.

Digging in the earth,
Beyond the roots of the soul,
And the origin of the genes,
You keep bumping into the stones,
Which the commodities form the bottom,
From the blue clay of Zeeland,
And the rock solid confidence,
Between you and me



On an endless journey far from mother, wife and child,
There is always a hiding place where I find my brothers in arms.
On an endless journey far from mother, wife and child,
There is always a hiding place where I find my brothers in arms.

Floating through distant lands,
Skies through the clouds,
Sometimes we reach rumors,
We make mind wander,
Of a self set goal,
The wid that rushes past my ears,
Is like a fiery wild longing for the warmth of my house,


At the end of my wanderings in the lee of the wind,
I always come to the crossroads where I find my brothers in arms,
On an endless journey far from mother, wife and child,
There is always a hiding place where I find my brothers in arms. <|endoftext|> 
I haven't thought about you for a long time
I had more or less forgotten you
but suddenly I wonder
where have you been all this time

broken and injured
I suddenly miss you
much more than I ever think

ohhhhh if only you were here
if only you were here with me
ohhhhh if only you were here
if only you were here with me

it was not indifference
but more how feet sometimes walk into the wilderness
and they brought me this far
but now, now I open up to you

far away and unknown
I suddenly miss you
and don't know where you are



ohhhh if only you were here
if only you were here with me
ohhhh if only you were here
if only you were here with me

There was emptiness
between you and me
we said goodbye
that is freedom
now i notice
that I've lost my way
I would like to
that you bring me home

ohhhhhhh if only you were here
if only you were here with me
ohhhhhhhh if only you were here
if only you were here with me
Ohhhhh if only you were here
if only you were here with me
ohhhh if only you were here
if only you were here with me
Here with me <|endoftext|> 
I waited
until it really could no longer
until the sun was too high again
I thought
that you have more to stay
and that I let myself be driven away
lonely like a wolf
I waited
longer than a human can bear

I bring myself
to the edges of the land
where the ocean begins
to the water and the sand
where the ocean begins
there I lie down
where the ocean begins



I waited
in the heart of the desert
it couldn't be warmer anywhere
and in the night
I could hope what I wanted
my teeth chattering, shivered
and cold to the bone
I waited
longer than a human can bear

I bring myself
to the edges of the land
where the ocean begins
to the water and the sand
where the ocean begins
there I lie down
where the ocean begins <|endoftext|> 
The roof of the world
Wait for me until I get there
Until I find out
That it has disappeared
I can go further than I think

I surrender
I lie down

I'm free
With my feet on the ground
And my hands by the sun
I'm free
There is no heaven and no hell
It's the cause of itself

My arms wide
I want to be there when I'm alive
Let me be human
Who is not looking for anything
Because he doesn't need anything anymore

I surrender
I lie down



I'm free
With my feet on the ground
And my hands by the sun
I'm free
There is no heaven and no hell
It's the cause of itself

You look up and you see how far it is
And yet close
You look for the glasses you see through
It is near
You are free

You are free
With your feet on the ground
And your hands to the sun
Free
There is no heaven and no hell
It's the cause of itself
Free <|endoftext|> 
The woman on the porch
Steals my attention, cool and fast
Dievegge of the night's rest
Makes me sweat in my hell
I can't forget
Because I saw something in her eyes
Of love and ability
To such great compassion
If you rarely see
The woman on the porch
Steals the daylight, dim and tired
Dievegge of the dusk
The evening falls to her
She will enslave me
Because the fire will join her soon
Like a candle in late hours
She makes them last longer
Frees this junkie
The woman on the porch
Steals my pride, so soft and sweet
The thief of pride
Once I was such a thief too
But then I dove into air
And I still heard her sigh
Up there on top of the tower
And lost in free fall
My big flight began
The woman on the porch
Steals my love, hard and cruel
Passion dievegge
About which I know little
And now the small wound still hurts
Which I connected carefree
With all hope for tomorrow
If she got me away
I'm back on the ground <|endoftext|>

They keep waiting

They wait around your place
They are your friends, they are crazy <|endoftext|> 
If I were roaming around
Over misty fields, in one
too thin jacket
Would you find me?
Would you find me then?

And if I lost
In lightning fast days with
their hunting pass
Would you find me?
Would you ever find me?

Strange roads
Brought me here
And later on even further
And further and further from home
But the answer is yes
You would find me

If I were to call you
In confusing times
in a cutting wind
Would you find me?
Would you find me then?



And if I crawled away
Not to have to be there
as an animal or as a child
Would you find me?
Would you ever find me?

Strange roads
Brought me here
And later on even further
And further and further from home
But the answer is yes
You would find me

Strange roads
Brought me here
And later on even further
And further and further from home

You don't wave for the picture
You just had fun
Touch me, one more kiss
A pure way
To do something nice

Don't ask me for secrets
Don't ask me to donate a song
I need everything now
Be who you are and let me go

We play for the beauty
We drink for consolation
Against love, death and the rest
So fair you blush
And that suits you best

Don't ask me for secrets
Don't ask me to donate a song
I need everything now
Be who you are and let me go

The days when we are carefree
Could toast to another day
We knew a lot
That they pass
That there was nothing behind it
And the things we did
Were urgent and late
We knew a lot
That it passes
It's all about now and here
So touch me, one more kiss
A pure way
To do something nice



Don't ask me for secrets
Don't ask me to donate a song
I need everything now
Be who you are and let me go
Don't ask me for secrets
Don't ask me for secrets <|endoftext|> 
Here's the list of things
That you still wanted to do
Here's the shoebox
With 1 million memories
What we did
And who we have been
And who we are now
That's also in it ...

If you want to think about the past
That's okay
But not too often
Rather think about today

Here's your suitcase
With clean clothes and a suit
Here's the purse
With toothpaste and aftershave
And what we did
And who we have been
And who we are now
That's also in it ...

And if you want to think about the past
That's okay
But not too often
Rather think about today.
Rather think about today.
Prefer today
Hey everything is fine
And no one is left alone
Hey it's good
This is where it went
We look forward to seeing you ...



Here's an alarm clock
For when you don't know the time
And a compass
For when you really want to go home
What we did
And who we have been
And who we will become
That will prove sooner or later

If you want to think
To what could have been
That's okay
But rather think about today
Rather think about today.
Rather think about today.
Rather think about today. <|endoftext|> 
Queen of hearts is waiting somewhere in the game
The dealer deals and takes a cigarette
Chances are no longer right,
the hope for profit still
Everything is used purposefully

Queen of hearts falls softly in front of me
The dealer laughs, he knows what I'm thinking now
She lies there nicely, but I cannot reach it
I'm afraid she beckons to someone else

Because it has to come, it has to go
Once it has to happen
It's done now or never
BLOF is desperately needed,
because the game is played high
The cards are just ...

Lord of spades kills me down
The dealer blows, his head disappears in smoke
It's too much, it's over
Too much, it cannot be added anymore
The money is gone - so are the cigarettes



Because it has to come, it has to go
It must happen once
It's done now or never
BLOF is desperately needed,
because the game is played high
The cards were simply dealt wrong
The cards were simply dealt wrong
The cards were simply dealt wrong
The cards were simply dealt wrong

Queen of hearts falls softly in front of me
She lies there nicely, but I cannot reach it

You remember when I sang
From that unknown road
So much has happened
Since that time

Some stayed for a long time
And others only briefly
Sometimes it hurt
If only I knew
Why

What I do know
Is what she did
And whatever I then
Early



She cares about me
She cares about me
She loves me
She cares about me

And now that I'm here again
On the brink of new beginnings
And those stories and rumors
Leave behind

Hear the voices in the night
Full of envy, hatred and envy
Oh come here
Just put your head here
Because what I do know
Is what you did
And whatever I asked then
She cares about me

She cares about me
She loves me
She cares about me
She gives me freedom <|endoftext|> 
And I started the car
I don't know what drove me
What power had taken possession of me
It must have been the Devil

And I shouted your name
Did you recognize the sound
Or did you think like everyone else
That a wolf howled
During the night

How many years have passed
That I lived like in a cell
With invisible walls
But you did feel it



And we made love
Set everything on fire
And we closed our ears
For the wolves in the night

The love of your life
Do not recognize you immediately
It's just one
different story
From a madman's diary

But it is a fine line
Between love and hate
Which of the two
Howls like a wolf underneath
the moon <|endoftext|> 
With the head in the air
In this shameless land
And in the snow by the lake
We write our name
And when the ice melts again
We wait for the sun
Finally together
And you wear my ring

How long has been waited for this
How many times did I break a heart
Nobody understands
But we are strong
We are proud
And in love
It's winter in Hamburg
And the sun that shines
Stay with me
Winter in Hamburg
Tonight is the full moon
So watch out
For this fool tonight
Who longs for you
Ohohoho
Oho oho



The man drives us around
Proud of his city
But we are blind
We will come back here someday
To this memory
To this cold city
Where there was love
In Germany

How long has been waited for this
How many times did I break a heart
Nobody understands
But we are strong
We are proud
And in love
It's winter in Hamburg
And the sun that shines
Stay with me
Winter in Hamburg
Tonight is the full moon
So watch out
For this fool tonight
In a winter in Hamburg
And the sun that shines
Stay with me
Winter in Hamburg
Tonight is the full moon
So watch out
For this fool tonight
Who longs for you
Ohohohohohoho
Oho oho
Who longs for you (winter in Hamburg)
Ohoho
Ohohohohohohooo
Who longs for you (winter in Hamburg)
Ohohoho

Oho oho
Who longs for you <|endoftext|>

And don't be afraid of anything anymore

    Even these words may be
    Well for me
    Like there was never anything in your whole life

I shout it from the rooftops
Or maybe not
These dirty hands
if only I were in grief
That I couldn't do anything
I acquit myself
We Survivors like that
do it daily

You could say that you
lost
But this victory
tastes bitter
When I think about you
What was I to you
And who you were for

And then there was silence
The streets are empty
Everyone is sleeping, everyone is alive
I'm going there
Direction Amsterdam
It's raining on the way to you

What have I lost
What do I bring
Will I ever be free
Wherever I go

Welcome to Utopia
The singer sang before I went
Welcome to Utopia
The past is left in the fog

For whom I loved
For whom I cheated
And never had time
Nobody is perfect
But this heart beats for thirty years
Continuously looking for
Searching for you

Welcome to Utopia
The answer is blowing in the wind
Welcome to Utopia
Everything is left in the fog



The nights alone I thought of you
In that language of yours
Who speaks my body
And feel what I feel for you
And do what I do to you

Welcome to Utopia
Always will, always will be

It happened again and again
Was it the drink
Anyway
It broke your heart

Day after day you wondered
Why she didn't disappear
Why she stayed with you

Little was enough for her
And nothing too much for you
Just admit it
Little, little, is not enough

She was so beautiful
Every man turns around
Loses pride
If she just passes by

All those days, all those nights
That you weren't there
Has she waited for you in vain



Little was enough for her
And nothing too much for you
Just admit it
Little, little, is not enough

You cheated on her, she cheated on you
Cheaters cheat each other
But what good is the truth
Sometimes it only hurts

Now you ask your best friend for advice
What should he do, what can he do
He does not know

Life goes on
And goodbye always hurts
As long as everything, everything, everything
Keep moving

Little was enough for her
And nothing too much for you
Just admit it
Little, little is not enough

Is not enough (is not enough)
Little is not enough
Is not enough
Little is not enough <|endoftext|> 
The nights were long
The nights were cold
the three of us without you
Lonely and quiet
in here
Here in this house

Now I say goodbye
Of being alone
And I greet you
Welcome you
Where were you

I'm going for you
Under all circumstances
I'm going for you
God knows where



You went to istanbul
And to Japan
To poles
Back home

You're so close
Here in my heart
Painfully close
On the phone
But so far away

I kiss your picture
Before bedtime
And become an idiot
Then I see you
Stand in front of me
As in a dream

I'm going for you
Under all circumstances
I'm going for you
God knows where <|endoftext|> 
Early in the morning
He stands up

To the beat of the clock, oh, oh, oh, oh

To a hungry scream

Late in the evening
This is his day off
Busy streets
And nobody moves aside, oh, oh, oh, oh
The fear in his eyes
And someone is calling after him



Sometimes in his dreams
He takes revenge
His wife then wakes up
Hears him scream in his sleep

As long as there is hope
As long as the fire is still burning
Pass by the torch
It glows in your heart
Black, white, you and me
Stand in front of the gates
Of the promised land, the promised land

And I take my time
I take everything as it is
I'm not saying goodbye anymore

And I feel close to you
I feel how it was again
I feel better now

Do you know what it is
Do you know what it is
Do you know what it is



If nothing is left
Then the thoughts and the hope
On a change
Of time

Then I'm going to look for you
In a land of love
in a land of fertility

Do you know what it is

I left the sun for what it is
And I broke through the sound
And it went quiet

I searched beyond the horizon
To what I actually already had
I was closer to the core
Than I thought

And it's good to see you again
Maybe way too long ago
Let's go to town
And we're looking for a song

Why else are we here
Why else are we here



I was on top of the mountain
Had a distant and clear view
It was a full moon
And I thought I knew everything

But the longer I live
The less I know
And what does not matter
Is what I forget

And it's good to see you again
Maybe way too long ago
Let's go to town
And we drink to a song

Why else are we here
Why else are we here <|endoftext|> 
Pale gray streets, there is some fog
Your eyes water, because of the razor-sharp wind
A raised hand
Wave to an invisible friend

refr .:
    And where do you come from
    It's like nobody's there
    Who talks to you

The neon light falls like snow from the sky
It colors your face and your hands white
A voice from across the street
Above the traffic noise

Who talks to you

What matters now
Time has forgotten
What matters now
Is to forget that you exist

Soon it will disappear again
Like the shade of this tree
Soon the whole life will appear
A thought, a forgotten dream



What it's all about now
Is making a decision
So that the ax goes down
And not just keep floating above your head

I'll meet you again later
Whether or not started again
Soon it will appear to be a decision
Worth more than losing
While you think you have won

And the ax cuts through the trunk
And takes the shadow with it
I've always loved you
There has never been any doubt about that <|endoftext|> 
She's on the edge
From his bed
Her searching hand
Goes trembling
To his shoulder

Strokes his hair
She closes her eyes
She thinks about the years
She gives him a kiss

And she said goodbye dear boy
Save a place for me
A place free for me
Somewhere up there, somewhere up there



And for a moment he looked
And for a moment he seemed
Young and old again
Without age
At the same time
He smiled

And all the worries
And all the grief
And all the tears
Fainted

And she said goodbye dear boy
Save a place for me
A place free for me
Somewhere up there, somewhere up there <|endoftext|> 
In the morning it was cool
The plants woke up
Is it possible, ever really
To be far away
I wondered
When I was there
The man wished me a good morning
Good morning and, I wish it were true, that it was true, I wish it were true, that it was true Thoughts are not tied to a place across land You look someone in the eye, strange eyes
The fathomless depth, the depth of the world

And I wish it were true, that it was true.
I wish it were true
Thoughts are not tied to any place over land
Did you ever want to go back
Is there anything you miss
Actually, you are never traveling



Questions live everywhere
Questions live everywhere

Questions live everywhere <|endoftext|> 
I feel good now
Thank you for asking
How are you
We haven't talked for so long
I am home again
I'm in again
But if you ask me if I miss her
But if you ask me what the truth is
I will not admit
Maybe after another glass
After all, we are friends among ourselves
Well, you know with a drink it is easier to talk



I feel good now
I say this with my heart in my throat
It makes sense for her
This has never been the case
Who hasn't seen them
Helpless and in love
But I'm afraid I'm one of those fools now
I fear I am lost forever
I will not admit
Maybe after another glass
After all, we are friends among ourselves
You know how that goes
Friends trust each other

I feel good now <|endoftext|> 
(Frank Boeijen and Wout Pennings)

It was on that day that it snowed very hard
And it got dark at two o'clock in the afternoon
She stood by the window and looked out
Not that she was bored with waiting for the front doorbell so often

refr .:
    Maybe someone will come by today
    Oh otherwise I'll watch the TV today
    Or I write a story, yes I will get it
    And tonight I go to bed early and tomorrow I live on with time
    As a friend

The cars stopped on the side of the street and saw faces
Behind a white car window as viewers looking for something
And half lost they stepped out and grabbed the ground
with red hands and threw around



Oh

refr.

Like that boy who lives upstairs with her
She often sees him walking through the front yard
But he has such a funny face and you never know what it is but it seems
As if he wanted to look at her to say something and then change his mind

Oh maybe that boy will come over today
Oh otherwise I'll watch the TV today
Or I write a story, yes I will get it
And tonight I go to bed early and tomorrow I live on with time
As a friend <|endoftext|> 
It's crazy
And I know
But I'm worried
Worrying about you

You could say that
You were a friend
You could say that
Our friendship
Came from one side

You know that
I cared about you
And still allowed
It breaks my heart
For two days
Have I been thinking about you
That was way too long
It turned out afterwards



I have dreamed of you
That you went down
You still use
I heard
I worry
Worrying about you

You could say that
It was pity
You could say that
Compassion
Came from one side

Maybe you want to
Just attention
But one day you will regret
Have you lost everything?
There is no one left
Have you lost everyone
Lost all your friends
A bum in town

A junkie in the night
A lost man
Say for yourself
Not afraid of anyone
Just for yourself
Not afraid of anyone
Just for yourself
Just for yourself <|endoftext|> 
Spring in Valencia

We sat around the table
The men continued to talk
Food was served
And I looked into your eyes

It was going to be a long night
Somewhere in the south
Southern Europe

What will the night bring us
A game was being played
With innocence in the eye

Spring in Valencia
Three dreamers in the spring sun
Spring in Valencia
Three dreamers in the spring sun

How can you do as much as possible
Tell in a short time
I wondered
When I saw you again



And now that I see you again
We meet halfway through
You went to the end of the world

In the end, there were no words
But a silent one
agreement
A blink of an eye
One glance is enough

Spring in Valencia
Three dreamers in the spring sun
Spring in Valencia
Three dreamers in the spring sun

What will the night bring us

Spring in Valencia <|endoftext|> 
Even if it is not much
This is for you
For you alone

I've been looking for words
During the night
In the city

No one has ever understood
When I sang about you
Talked about you
It didn't even come close



refr .:
    You are prettier
    Than I can ever sing
    You are prettier
    Than I can ever sing
    For you alone

I give you
What you me
Have given

My breath my hand
My voice my sound
My head my heart
It's for you

Sunday night
And the party you gave is really over
And what else can I do
Then think about what you did for me
The champagne is finished
And I think what you said every time you left
Always: 'Next time with us'
But that suddenly sounds so crazy now

Watch me sit
There is almost a mirror in the window
The battle is over
Not by me but by someone of my name
And I think about all those people
The Nobel Prize for friendship goes to you
Always: 'Next time with us'
I really hope not too soon

Let me drink
Let me drink to life
Let me drink
Let me drink that I'm alive
And let me quickly forget drinking
What I actually already knew
God made another mistake



The darker it gets
All the more I feel you next to me in the window
And it's snowing like I have to
I really need to get out
I'll drink you tonight
And tell about you until it wears off
And I cry with every glass
Haarlem has lost its king

Let me drink
Let me drink to life
Let me drink
Let me drink that I'm alive
And let me quickly forget drinking
What I actually already knew
God made another mistake <|endoftext|> 
Best of years, keep drinking to me tonight.
All your usual questions are answered again.

It's raining, yes it's raining, good night.
Let's go to sleep now, you say softly.
Listen lie down, wind moves the tear.
Is it raining, yes it is raining.
Good night

Just stay down, just stay down,
just stay down I say, and I'll say your name.



Anything answer
comes from me.
You are fulfilled.
Filled with infinity.

Just stay down, just stay down I say.

And I'll call your name. <|endoftext|> 
Are you here alone
Do you mind
When I join you
If I talk to you for a second

Not much to do here
No don't be afraid
I know what you are thinking
But I don't intend to do anything

refr .:
    Tonight it is full moon and full moon
    Time stands still for me
    I met her on a full moon
    And at the full moon I left her

What do you want to drink
Shall I ask if the man
Some music on
A roller or a quick-step



Look at me
Hey what do you think
If I ask you to dance
Just a minute

refr.

Although your hair is not the same color
The resemblance is so great
No don't go
No, don't stay standing for a while

refr. <|endoftext|> 
A shadow falls on my face
For my eyes like a blindfold
I don't see anything anymore, but
I feel your hand
I could trust you
Trust you
What more can I do then
Questions to you

Where are we going
You take me upstairs
A miracle awaits there
You promised

To be performed
I could believe you
Believe in you
Sorry
I doubt

They say that

There is no heaven
For a hopeless sinner
There is no heaven
For a sinner
If I



A storm is coming
With the rain
the sun disappears
The voice spoke last night
From my conscience
I envisioned them
The gods and the ghosts

Now you want to seduce me
To true paradise
But a shadow fell
On your face
But it is not time yet
For a hurried goodbye
Wait I don't want to go
I have another question

Is it true

That there will be no heaven
For the helpless sinner
There is no heaven
For a sinner

Is it true

That there will be no heaven
For the impotent sinner
There is no heaven
For a sinner

Suppose you don't go home
You let go of the final round
You only planned the first meters
The hardest from here
Suppose your head becomes your heart
And you walk to the station
And you lean on the thought
If you wait on the platform

It doesn't matter what you did yesterday
It's about what you only know tomorrow
Wander'on

Suppose you succeed
And you give the city your back
Do you need to know where you are going?
And when will you come back?

Because you dreamed of leaving
And you spoke of going nowhere
Can you miss what you leave behind?
Can you actually be alone?



Because it doesn't matter what you did yesterday
It's about what you only know tomorrow
Wander'on

Suppose you haven't gone anywhere
And you miss what you once had
Are you hero enough to go back
To what you owned?

Suppose you will never leave
But you just go home?
Tomorrow is a dream over
Or will you only be home then?

It doesn't matter what you did yesterday
It's about what you only know tomorrow
Wander'on! <|endoftext|> 
That's good

Stay a while
Just here
Tell me everything is the way it should be
Make new words
Make up life
Lie sweet because I don't want anything but this
And so it is good

Because the night disappears
You have to be blind if you want to miss the morning light
It's coming
It comes in leaps and bounds
And I don't want to

Just here
A little while longer together
For a while no one says how it can be done
Drink the silence
Taste life
I don't ask for anything and I get everything I want
And so it is good



I know there will be a tomorrow
You know that too
All too well
Suddenly so many things
Suddenly everything that has to be done
Suddenly the whole world of everyone all over me
Suddenly so many songs
And then I'll leave you alone

But not yet
Just take it easy
Just pretend that this will not pass
Drink the silence
Very carefully
The slower you drink the longer it seems
And so it is good

Drink the silence
The slower you drink the longer it seems
And so it is good

That's good <|endoftext|>

Hey singer sing your song but just know that I know
Even if you sing so sympathetically someone else wrote you sorrow
I can hear your words floating from every store in town
But it doesn't sound like you like her just like that
Sweet when I've had her

Nanananana Whohoho Nananana

Hey singer say I'm sorry forgetting what I just said
Because what I accused you of hits right back on me
Because how well I could sing from the pain that ate me
Until she gave my words truth
The sweetest love I ever had

Had I been told that real sorrow would feel like that
If I had long ago I would have said I love you too
Only when it has happened to you will you understand it
If you love her as much as I do
As sweet as I have had her



Nananana
As sweet as I had her
Nananana
As sweet as I was

She could give herself as a girl, you could take as a woman
She cried with the movie if the director wanted to
She could catch your thoughts in a casual sense
And she smoked like a pirate danced like a gypsy

And for seven long years she made my songs light
Only now that she has left do they gain some weight
Hey singer you know what it is and maybe it is
That she would still have been here
if she loved her as much as I would have loved her

Nananana
As sweet as I had her
Nananana
As sweet as I was
Nananana
As sweet as I was
Nananana
As sweet as I was

Already know what's to come
And my God how hard it is
It is really unstoppable now
Sand in my heart
Tonight I sit down and do all the wrong things
Drink me all over
To be able to sing the blues

It usually comes when things go well
It usually comes after the intoxication
At every start of every success
Scour the sand off old blues
It is far too great a sum
From pain through months
Walked on for way too long
Far too long and too alone

I'll sit down for the blues
Sand in my heart (sand in my heart)
I'll sit down for the blues

And then I sit down again
Then I'll just force it
With lots of booze and dead pictures
And sing bad songs
And drink for those tears
Who have waited too long
I have to drown the pain now
Tonight is now or never



I'll sit down for the blues
Sand in my heart (sand in my heart)
I'll sit down for the blues

Sit down for the blues
Sand in my hard
I must die, but not die
Twice as hard
Sand in my heart

Walked on for way too long
Far too long and too alone

sit for the blues
sand in my heart
I sit down for the blues <|endoftext|> 
She's not a cure for the ticking of the clock
No hope
No guide
No port at night

No source in the desert when you are dying of thirst
Not the smile at your worst joke

She's not a hit chorus that sounds off the scaffolding.
Not the most expensive wine you drink without a hangover
Not a flower garden in bloom
Not one night in a thousand
Not an outstretched hand
Not the end of all my waiting


No more than I actually want to admit
She makes the difference


She's not a lame excuse for what I would have liked to be
Not a dream
No purpose
Not a stick to hit with

No guarantee of a long happy life
It is not an answer to the question of our existence

Not the most beautiful symphony among the film called: We two
Not the clean cool bed that can take away my fevers
Not the beat of my heart
Not the clearest conscience
She didn't come at the right time
And I don't care either




Because even more than I want to admit
She makes the difference


Between everything I had and how it suddenly started to live
What is sketched in pencil can be drawn in color

Between never going on and experiencing everything
Between never and maybe very sometimes
And between me and us

So many songs, so many words
It must all be said
But whatever she tries
No comparison is right

Maybe it is a bit simple
But all I want to hear ... is
She makes the difference
she makes the difference


Because she's not a good conversation
What no dog is waiting for.
Not the flag I'm fighting under
No advice on all my complaints
Not the very last way out
Which we have not thought about for a long time


But even more than I want to admit
She makes the difference
she makes the difference
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh <|endoftext|> 
slowly I see through all the trees again
somewhere at the end a little wood
From now on I will no longer give up
I loose my hair

and tonight you will know what you have forgotten
how nice I can be
everyone will hear that I am reborn
and you live your life without me

days weeks months flew by
lost my own opinion times
but you no longer live here by my side
you're not kidding me anymore



and tonight you will know what you have forgotten
how nice I can be
everyone will hear that I am reborn
and you live your life without me

further with you became my downfall
that's why I had to leave you
now i do what i can't resist
listen to what I say to you

and tonight you will know what you have forgotten
how nice I can be
everyone will hear that I am reborn

December cold
I suddenly don't feel it anymore
the heat comes from you

i found a woman
who likewise loves this atmosphere
from which I would learn

this year
did not start very well
the more I enjoy love in my heart more
she stays with me
I'll be Santa to her
also in the new year



Christmas has never been his party
(usually it was lonely)
Christmas has never been his party
because now I have you!

this year did not start very well
the more I enjoy love in my heart more
she stays with me
I'll be Santa to her
also in the new year

For several weeks now
Don't ask me why
I turned out to be naughty
Looked wrong
Maybe that's why

Whenever I want to ask you
What I have done to you
Then you won't see me anymore

Chorus
What I want to know about you
How this continues
Are you going to forget me like this
I will soon be on the street
Tell your plans anyway
I get another kiss
What in my uncertainty
I don't know what to do anymore
What I want to hear from you
Are you still mine
Everything is now lost
The end is near
Tell your plans anyway
I get another kiss
What in my uncertainty
I don't know what to do anymore



You keep ignoring me
I am being extinguished
Can I learn from this
Should I repent
It plays in my head
Whenever I want to ask you
Whether I should leave already
Then you won't see me anymore

Chorus
What I want to know about you
How this continues
Are you going to forget me like this
I will soon be on the street
Tell your plans anyway
I get another kiss
Because in my uncertainty
I don't know what to do anymore
What I want to hear from you
Are you still mine
Everything is now lost
The end is near
Tell your plans anyway
I get another kiss
Because in my uncertainty
I don't know what to do anymore

Do not know what to do <|endoftext|> 
Night after night
It's haunted my mind
The kiss of another
Anesthetized me
How do I proceed now
The truth hurts
Since you can't be here anymore

Because one kiss and everything was lost
One kiss and you were away from me
Those lonely nights so chilly and cold
I'm lying awake, thinking about you

Because a kiss and everything was lost
One kiss and it was all over
And so without words you left
And you left me alone

It seemed very harmless
Wasn't meant to be
Still you have it later
felt differently
I want to fight for you
Know I'm sorry
love I don't want to lose you anymore

Because a kiss and everything was lost
One kiss and you were away from me
Those lonely nights so chilly and cold
I'm lying awake, thinking about you



Because a kiss and everything was lost
One kiss and it was all over
And so without words you left
And you left me alone

Let me tell you
That I care about you
That you are everything to me

And that all my life
It's all about you
Ever since the day I met you

Because one kiss and everything was lost
One kiss and you were away from me

I'm lying awake, thinking about you

It is not normal for every child
To live without fear
For them it is a fairytale story
So give them a chance anyway

Not every child is used to it
To get what it wants
So realize where you were born
It's a world of difference

Because every child deserves a home
A close family to live with
Where you are carefree yourself
You are surrounded by love
Because every child deserves a home
A sibling to play with
Protected hands around you
Where you can share happiness with them
That's home



Not everything is going as it should
With children just like us

The rising morning sun shines straight in my face
That rising morning sun is sharply focused on me
I enjoy the Netherlands after a few days of baking on the beach

It was last Saturday with friends at the sea
Yes I was able to come along again last Saturday
The whole coast was overcrowded
But my god, what fun we had

A day like that always goes way too quickly
Can time go back for a moment

Refr.
When the evening then passes
I quickly make a wish
Shut my mouth and close my eyes
And dwell on that moment
Yes when the evening passes
I squeeze my hands for a moment
I enjoy this evening so much
Because before you know it it will be light again

I will not be there very often in the near future
So last Saturday it always stays with me
Can take it again now, because this will remain in my memory

A day like that always goes way too quickly
Can time go back for a moment



Refr.
When the evening then passes
I quickly make a wish
Shut my mouth and close my eyes
And dwell on that moment

I've been standing here all day
And look out the window, look around
See the world and the people
I've been standing here all day
And look out the window, look around
See the world and the people
i think of you

I watch the hustle and bustle of my city
see the most beautiful faces she has
and some would be exactly my case, no matter

Whatever that is, I know you are

One of them all
that I want in the world
of all the one
just you and no other
I missed you
One of them all
never loved like this
There are no questions
i don't wanna say it
if I don't mean it!

I've tried so many
a lot has happened and nothing has happened
damn it was free i felt nothing, playful



And I thought those were the rules
because to commit myself was infinitely remote
now I want it and I know the reason is you!

One of them all
from now on
until the end
a next eternity!

And even further,
take all my heart
You are for me.

One of them all
that I want in the world
of all the one
just you and no other
I missed you
One of them all
never loved like this
There are no questions
i don't wanna say it
if I don't mean it!

One of them all
that I want in the world
of all the one
just you and no other
I missed you
One of them all
never loved like this
There are no questions
i don't wanna say it
if I don't mean it! <|endoftext|> 
You will find out
Sooner or later
A good friend
A best mate
You need them
In good and in evil
Because the way of existence
Sometimes very unpleasant
There is a fall
And immediately got up again

I have friends for life
Supported by joys and sorrows
What a friend can give to me
Money is not spent on it
You have friends you can laugh with
And so you quickly forget the time
Or a friend who can ease your pain
If you don't remember



Wordless
Notice you quickly
This friend
Please understand me
Good faith
Is all that matters
Even a look says enough
For that close-knit team of friends
There is laughter
All together in the pub

I have friends for life
Supported by joys and sorrows
What a friend can give to me
Money is not spent on it
You have friends you can laugh with
And so you quickly forget the time
Or a friend who can ease your pain
If you don't remember

freedom that's for me,
just a day off.
hang around the house,
I feel at home in the old village.

freedom on a terrace,
with old friends and a glass.
just have a laugh with each other
that's what I keep in my heart ..

I am happy there on the dike,
I feel like heaven rich there
far away from all appearances
just because I can be myself there ..

freedom is not for sale,
and when I walk next to my shoes.
then 1 shouts in plain language
hey say you ff normal ..



I am happy there on the dike
I feel like heaven rich there
far away from all appearances,
just because I can be myself there.

freedom in abundance
is the supreme good.
where I was born
and where I know all people .......

I am happy there on the dike
I feel like heaven rich there
far away from all appearances
just because I can be myself there ..

far away from all appearances
just because I can be myself there .. <|endoftext|> 
Jan Smit - Friendship (is worth gold)

Sometimes there is such a day
Which you would prefer to skip
it rains in your heart
The world seems to end
A love that disappeared / the love / your love
And you wonder where to
You've had it all
You are alone

Refr.
Friendship, friendship is worth gold
Even if you don't see each other every day
They're the real friends
who always support you - you know
That a friend never forgets you



Friendship, friendship is worth gold
If you don't see how to proceed
Then you just have to know
That they think of you - you feel
That true friendship never cooled

Nowhere does the sun shine
Leave the curtains drawn
The rain in your heart
Fight for a little ray of light
The day loses its glow
And you almost lose heart
No, you don't believe in it anymore
Still, it will be fine because

I haven't seen you in so long
you are now dealing with someone else
I keep myself tall think you look at it
disappear with the northern sun

but yesterday I thought of you again
and called before bed
but a strange voice be soft
she's mine she stays all night

(Chorus)
but why, why do I feel such a pain
when I can't be with you at night
maybe I'm kidding myself again
and you stay away from me

but why can't I do without you
come tell me what I would tell you
and then whisper very softly,
stay with me tonight.

the love for us is really over now
you know but you don't say it
I saw you walking so I called your name
as hard as I could but you didn't see me

but when I dream I dream of you
you kiss me and you smile at me



and you say understand me right
I want you I don't want the other

 (chorus 2x)



stay with me tonight, stay with me tonight, stay with me tonight. <|endoftext|> 
The world seems too big, you feel small
There does not seem to be a shred of certainty
You prefer to lie in bed all day,
waiting for that alarm clock to save you.
You muster up the courage to rise
and saves the newspaper, where did it go wrong.
You realize what the purpose is this day.
Show that you radiate with a smile.

refr.
Like a bird so free,
all worries passed.
As of today I will put everything aside.
View life by day,
because nothing is mandatory, everything is allowed.
The whole world is happy when you smile.

Life is about numbers and money.
Still, that's not all that matters.
Happiness matters to everyone,
because no one likes to be lonely or alone.
I am more than fed up with all those wars.
And I have had it with problems.
So enjoy everything you do.
Because joy makes up for everything.

Honey, what was it
I forgot your name
Honey, how about it
How did he go again

After that night in the cafe
You walked with me for a while
I almost immediately forgot what you told me

But how you turn or turn it
You were sleeping in my bed
Yes you were mine last night

CHORUS:
I am in love, but not with you
Because I'm crazy about another woman
Maybe very mean
But you are alone again
We don't really belong together

I am in love but not with you
I do regret our night
I'm thinking of the none
To my love before
Back to my ex I want her

Honey, I'm sorry
I should have known better
Honey, how are you doing
Time cannot go back

No matter how many times I resisted
You seduced me over and over
I was embarrassed by the words you said



But how you turn or turn it
I was lying there on that bed with you
Yes you slept next to me last night

CHORUS:
I am in love, but not with you
Because I'm crazy about another woman
Maybe very mean
But you are alone again
We don't really belong together

I am in love but not with you
I do regret our night

To my love before
Back to my ex I want her

Of those days

you know that such a nasty day when it is not
this is how it is supposed to be and everyone sees it
your tire punctured and your phone lost in the sea
you await tomorrow
because today is not going well

those are those days that you must quickly forget
the sun always passes after rain
just look ahead and have fun in life
away with all that misery and back to happiness

the power goes out you're late a third time in a row
that is the final straw for your boss, you are free for the time being
your wife left the door open for you at home
she was not really satisfied and left you

those are those days that you must quickly forget
the sun always passes after rain
just look ahead and have fun in life
away with all that misery and back to happiness

it is not always easy when the weather is bad
keep up the courage it will be fine
because in time you will get better
everything is on track



those are those days that you must quickly forget
the sun always passes after rain
just look ahead and have fun in life
away with all that misery and back to happiness

I've been in the sand for a while now
just woke up in Tobago on the beach
you have already flown
was gone before it started
am alone and look at the horizon

palms keep waving past me
those towering waves, it makes me happy
someday I will find you
I wouldn't know where you are
have long been used to this loneliness

wish I could keep sailing forever
on that beautiful blue sea
about oceans
in your mind you are with it



if only I could keep sailing
to an endless existence
no longer alone, but happiness around me
a dream that will never end

I'd love to stay here until I die
those pearly white beaches and my boat
I never get bored
it remains a good idea
and the warmth goes with me forever

wish I could keep sailing forever
on that beautiful blue sea
about oceans
in your mind you are with it

if only I could keep sailing

I can't do without friends

If necessary, you can do without money
although that is not pleasant for your stomach.
Even worse when a woman torments you
because then your heart still hurts.
I know it can be awful.
I prefer to have a friend with whom I will soon
long nagging can be how it was
and I am comforted in my sorrow.
My friends, pour me another glass,
because without friends I cannot.
Life is strange, I love
already not so much of alcohol,
but of all things for a woman
I whip in until I'm full
and sobbing with bitter fun
fall asleep in a chair.
There a friend finds me, clears my place.
I shake, mumbling a song out of tune
because I feel happy anyway
because without friends I cannot.



I've been cheated more often
I have also loved a woman more.
It always went out, but to that hell
no one thinks when it begins,
a man always remains a child.
Who does not dream of paradise,
suddenly no one gets old and wise.
You often get grief for joy,
the journey is not an easy one,
but I can't do without friends.

Let me slide, because I save
still some of it.
Now prince, hear this prayer,
take everything if there is no other way,
only my friends, leave them.
Nothing else remains for me, oh Lord,
It couldn't be more disastrous.
While you see me in tears
I swear if necessary: ​​I no longer drink.
But I can't do without friends. <|endoftext|> 
I browse and search an old dusty book.
How sweet and small I was.
I lost most of that time.
Glad there are pictures.
From us in the street where everything is still going,
as it has been.
Neighbors to one, you were never alone.
I miss that the most.

I think back so often
how it used to be.
Always fame in the streets,
of the children from each class.
Boys and girls enough,
everyone together.
I can talk for hours
go back in time so many times,
after so many years.

With a ball at my foot
I was usually sweet.
As long as I could play.
They walked home, I just went home
flush with the summer sun.

I think back so often
how it used to be.
Always fame in the streets,
of the children from each class.
Boys and girls enough,
everyone together.
I can talk for hours
go back in time so many times,
after so many years.

When I enter the street just like that
then I feel at home, at our parental home,
because time really flew by, so passed.

Until now it was never quite perfect,
burned cities and a people to die for,
an unbridled love, a third who could spoil it,
it was never quite perfect until now.

It has been said that there will be other times,
there has been a fight for a new decency.
What others said was not listened to
I don't feel like doing it again.

Better avoid all your friends now
they change quickly and are no longer as they were then.

The great truth is now outdated,
what used to be law is now prohibited by law,
the elderly are no longer half gods as they used to be
and the fish is no longer paid so dearly.

Of course there are people who are still suffering
and peace is still a vision.
It's no time to spread your bed now,
although there are people who already do that.

So it is better to avoid all your friends
they change quickly and are no longer as they were then.



But for God's sake don't think we're here yet
there are still some things to do.
And it keeps fighting even though the others don't stop whining
that it used to be better, so quiet and so nice.

Those are your friends who used to say
that they would do it differently later.
They wanted to free themselves from any authority.
Now they don't do anything, they keep their decency.

So it is better to avoid these friends,
they change quickly and are no longer as they were then.

Tomorrow it will be like today again
it seems changed, but you know better.
Though the ground gets hotter beneath your feet meanwhile,
you don't pay, you are too slow.

It has been said other times are coming
there has been a fight for a new decency.
What others said was not listened to
I don't feel like doing it again.

That's why I've decided to avoid you
you are the same, no more friends as then. <|endoftext|> 
Who else can tell me
of the early morning
with gold dust in the mouth
what the poets write about?
What time came then
the first swallow from the summer green
dressed in aprons
to ease the cleaning?

The milkman up at four
to start milking cows,
to peel eggs
with the chickens on the roost.
And the filling man in the street
who didn't want to greet anyone,
face full of honey freckles,
then earned a maier
at Knul de Spulleman.

Where's that sweet cold time?
Where is it in the quick?
Long live the I-love-yours.

There was a lot of talk
about Kraai de Kanselein,
his body hurt him
for he suffered the die then.
But otherwise life was good
and everyone was at peace.
A lot of bicycles were used
and people lived on the business.

Only on Sundays it was quiet,
then they slept in the churches.
That was very noticeable
for the clan was not hil.
And in the evening when it was dark,
then you went on the throats,
there the feathers flew
until the night thunders
and the day was broken.



Where's that sweet cold time?
Where is it in the quick?
Long live the I-love-yours.

Who else can tell me
of the first flying men?
Have you seen him too
when he crashed down?
Now you chuckle, but you don't chuckle
if you crash.
An airplane is a trick
that cannot be used for sports.

And our street never went mad
no cars and no cyclists,
no buses and no bicycles
because you didn't have that anymore.
Life was like that in our village
full of sagas and legends,
full of vague and acquaintances,
ready to go out
at the first calf collection.

Where's that sweet cold time?
Where is it in the quick?
Long live the I-love-yours.

Who else can tell me
shy of those days.
It is quite disappointing to me
to count bye bye. <|endoftext|> 
The neighborhood is being cleaned up and the houses must be flat
and the people are looking and they say, do you see that?
A whole family still lives in that old demolition house,
imagine, such a damp house, well, what do they see in it?
See, that couple is barely twenty and they already have a child,
well, they sure think they can live off the wind.
And then they nod satisfied and then they go home quickly,
to their job and to their car and the television at home.

They were bad houses and they lived clandestinely,
they had no light there and no water besides,
but they were happy there with four walls and a roof,
they also had lacquer on luxury and expensive furniture.
But the house has to be demolished, because there will be a large office,
the family is now on the street, but yes, the money always comes first.
And you can easily say that in your own beautiful house,
with your job and with your car, with the television at home.



Even though they were now homeless, they had learned one thing:
in order to just live, you must first be registered.
First a house and then get married, so then you have a few years
just friendly and sitting looking at each other.
When you are tired of waiting and a child comes anyway,
you have to see that you will find something to live in yourself.
Because the people shame and they stay home safely
and discuss the problems on the television tube.

And the family then moves on to a different demolition neighborhood
and they are then also sent out of there after a while.
And are you back on the street with your furniture and your child,
then it won't help much if you complain.
Because when you point out the situation to those officials,
then they say, I'm sorry, you're at the end of the list.
And then they happily think of their own beautiful home,
to their job and to their car, to the television at home. <|endoftext|> 
Mr. President, good night.
Sleep well in your beautiful white house.
Don't think too much about all those distant shores
where your boys are, lonely, far from home.
Don't think about those forty-six deaths,
that mistake last with that bombing.
And forget the fourth of those Ten Commandments
whom you certainly know as a good Christian.

Don't think about all those young frontline soldiers
dying alone in the distant tropical night.
Let that soft pacifist clique talk
mr president, sleep tight.

Just dream of victory and victory
dream of your beautiful ideal of peace
that has never been obtained by bloody murders,
dream that you will succeed this time.
Just don't think about all those people who fuck up
how many women, how many children have been murdered.
Dream that you will be the winner
and do not believe a word of all this opposition.



Bayonets with bloody hilts
keep watch at your command far from here
for the glory and honor of the free west.
Mr. President, sleep tight.

Don't be too alarmed when you are in your dreams
sees all those guiltless victims
who died in the fight over there
and ask you how much longer this should go on.
And you will know so slowly
that there are people who are sick of violence,
who do not forget the blood and the misery
and for whom a human life still counts.

Don't dream too much about all those dead people
dream of victory and power.
Don't think about all those peace wishes.
Mr. President, sleep tight. <|endoftext|>

Although I have been lost more than once
And I drive long distances
Although I don't know where you live
I'm on my way to find you
So rest assured tonight I'm coming

I will travel endlessly
Even if I miss the last train
I just want to be with you

A hundred thousand roads already lead
All towards a different goal
Although I wouldn't know who you are
I'm on my way to find you
Tonight I ride my gut



Let's not think about it
How many roads there are
I just want to be with you

Although I don't know where I come from
Nor what I did yesterday
I only know what I want
I'm on my way to find you
And I know you know that

However far it is, however long the roads
The world is small tonight
I just want to be with you

However far it is, however long the roads
The world is small tonight
Because I want to be with you
I just want to be with you <|endoftext|> 
The sea is falling, the sea is sinking
and burning the sun rises.
The frightened water carrier fetches more water
because the sea is dry.

The sea rises, the sea rises
and slowly the sun descends.
The water bearer toils and pants,
maybe he'll make it today.
Because the sea must be saved from the sun.
Because the sea must be saved from the sun.

Water carrier, carry the water to the sea.
Water carrier, carry the water to the sea.

The sea coast, the sea quenches
and the hot evening sun goes out.
The water carrier sleeps and rests,
satisfied that he could make it
and the sea has saved from the sun.
And the sea has saved from the sun.



Water carrier, carry the water to the sea.
Water carrier, carry the water to the sea.

The sea burns, the sea burns,
the water bearer scorches his back.
The sun is rising at the back,
the water bearer hurries back.
Because the sea must be saved from the sun.
Because the sea must be saved from the sun.

Water carrier, carry the water to the sea.
Water carrier, carry the water to the sea.

Carry the water to the sea.
Carry the water to the sea. <|endoftext|> 
A song just for you.

The love I've been looking for, I've found with you.
you are the stone of my happiness with which I build the future.
I want to share with you every new morning that awaits you.
that's why I now say with all my heart that I love you.

You freed me from grief because of you I have my smile again.
Deliver me from loneliness and see the light of the day.
You make every shadow that brings life disappear.
Everything that was no longer there for me, you brought back.



I walk the way you go, tell me you never leave me.
your love keeps me off the street.

I'm singing this song for you alone, it's my own feeling.
because of you I know what love is and what is meant by it.
Words often fall too short, but look into my eyes.
They say more than I can tell you what I feel about you.

They say more than I can ever say what I feel about you. <|endoftext|> 
Like a battle with clear skies,
I got a message.
My world stopped spinning
was a slap in the face.

I could not believe it,
it was like someone was numbing me
that soon I'll be without you.
Is what I now deny ....

Without goodbye, you have been taken away.
Gone are your dreams, gone forever ...
Without goodbye, your journey continues upward.
With a sea of ​​roses, to Paradise ...

I miss those moments together now.
I see you smiling at me.
I still want to ask so many questions.
Think about everything you said ....



There is so much to explain.
I would have liked to say a lot more.
Yes, this goodbye is hard for me
but it is really true ...

Without goodbye, you have been taken away.
Gone are your dreams, gone forever ...
Without goodbye, your journey continues upward.
With a sea of ​​roses, to Paradise ...

With a sea of ​​roses, to Paradise ...

With a sea of ​​roses ....
I say to you .... Goodbye ...... <|endoftext|> 
The stars may know if I'll ever see you again
But now I live in uncertainty
I don't even know where you are anymore, I never knew you like that
But I've lost you way too long

refr .:
    So many days, so many nights, it seems like a lifetime
    How long will you keep me waiting here because it scares me so
    Is that time for both of us really over
    Please let me know, it's so hard for me
    Please let me know, it's so hard for me



I thought it will be okay sometime, but this break now seems like forever
Although I do not accept it that way
It's not too late for us, as long as you talk to me
But when will I see you again?

refr.

(Please let me know it's so hard for me)
(Please let me know it's so hard for me) <|endoftext|> 
It was so beautiful from afar
And I hope someday I will be forgiven
I spent my days dreaming you were with me
It was so beautiful from afar

How could I think it would be any different
How could I think it was bigger than the world
How could I think we would be together



It was so beautiful from afar
And I will never forget you
I spend the days knowing it will continue to hurt
It was so beautiful from afar

And there is no one who can sympathize
And no one has to say anything comforting
And there is no one who has to clean up for me
I'll do that myself

It was so beautiful from afar
And I hope someday I will be forgiven
How could I think it would be any different?
How could I think it was bigger than the world?
How could I know what it's like to be so sorry
Or is it just elapsed time?
It was so beautiful from afar. <|endoftext|> 
I accepted you
I walked away
away from the noise
away from home
away from the cold
away from everything that bothered me
but most of all away from you

Hey falling angel, I want you to take my hand
I'm not getting away from you

Hey falling angel
you remain an angel

I just stopped running
when I looked, and when I saw nothing more familiar
I was not going anywhere further
away from everything I loved
and mostly I was alone

Hey falling angel
I want you to take my hand
I'm not getting away from you



Hey falling angel
angel you stay
Then we just fall together

So drag me with you
I just hope we land somewhere
with the two of us

Hey falling angel
I want you to take my hand
I'm not getting away from you

Hey falling angel
then we just coincide
because you will remain an angel

Hey falling angel (x2) <|endoftext|> 
Every slow day
A holy medicine
I am not sick
I just feel a little pain
But every black night
A cup full of venom
I am not sick
But I could have been better
Two cold hands on my body
Not even yours, they're mine
Two cold hands on my body
I can feel them burning
Every slow day
A pill for the pain
I am not sick
And I don't want to be either
But every black night
A poisonous drug
I am not sick
But I should have been better
Two cold hands
Two cold hands on my body
Not even yours, they're mine
Two cold hands on my body
I can feel them burning <|endoftext|> 
Nobody knows the way in my town anymore
We are on the side
without or with bad luck
Indifferent, stoned or drunk
Trembling with anger or
half mad with fear
I stand still, dare not do anything
The engine just keeps running,
the gasoline is running out
Someone is calling
Nobody is going
We are no good
We are not mad

There is always work in my city
in progress
We have to wait,
often and for far too long
A barrier, the street is open
Stones that lure,
a siren sings out of tune
I'm stuck here, I can't do anything
The meter keeps running and the
money is running out
Someone is cursing
Someone hits
It's not going well
It pisses me off

I need a taxi right before my eyes
Give them shelter and fire
I need a taxi right before my eyes
At this godforsaken hour



In my state ...

I need a taxi right before my eyes
Give them shelter and fire
I need a taxi right before my eyes
At this godforsaken hour <|endoftext|> 
I was blinded
Through the things around me
With myself alone
I couldn't watch
To the world that keeps turning
And slowly I disappeared into a hole
I was furious with everyone who said
That he knew how it was now
And how it happened
And how it should continue
What nonsense
Because nothing was necessary and there was simply too much

There could be too much
And I did not dare to choose
There could be too much
There was still so much to lose

A wind was blowing
And the trees were crooked
On a horizon that drifted
I put on my coat
And I fought through the rain
And slowly I disappeared into a storm
And I thought of everyone ever
Said to know something
But if it was ever understood
Then everything would have changed now
What nonsense
Because nothing was necessary, but there was simply too much



There could be too much
And I did not dare to choose
There could be too much
There was still so much to lose

Everything was open
The roads were empty
You could roam, you could walk
And none of what we got
Was too heavy or too light
Nothing weighed
That you couldn't bear
But now, but now there is too much
Too much that's stuck behind me

There could be too much
And I did not dare to choose
There could be too much
There was still so much to lose <|endoftext|> 
Suddenly you have lost your way
Rotate the map but nothing you recognize
A jungle has no paths
And you will fall if you run

Back
You want to go back
To a place where you've never been
Back to the world
And with that further back

And where is the crossroads then?
Peddling with your soul and thinking about selling
Is a luxury, not a sin
And a life must pass

Back
You want to go back
To a place where you've never been
Back to the world
And with that further back



By touch
On what you consider
Can't give a name
And don't hesitate
With what does not distress you
But live quite late

Everything out of your hands
Throw it away, put it down
Because birds that burn
Usually fly again

Back
You want to go back
To a place where you've never been
Back to the world
And then on again <|endoftext|> 
We drive through the night
the light shines ahead of us
The engine is roaring
more silence than sound
I only feel the breath of it
the friends around me
Who strokes my face warm,
and I see them one by one

Someone hums, someone smokes
Someone sleeps and wakes up
And says something to me
I startle from my thoughts:

That nothing is so beautiful and lonely
Like driving through the night
That is endless and peaceful
While you wait for me

Now feelings and thoughts are one
(One feeling, one thought)
We are tiny and huge,
as big as equally small
I'm hungry and tired
and that it will never end
And that it's okay either
that makes it worthwhile



Someone hums, someone smokes
Someone sleeps and wakes up
And says something to me
I startle from my thoughts:

That nothing is so beautiful and lonely
Like driving through the night
That is endless and peaceful
While you wait for me

That nothing is so beautiful and lonely
Like driving through the night
That is endless and peaceful
While you wait for me <|endoftext|> 
Hold me to your heart
I'm already at your feet
And I feel at home
Anyone who wants more must pay
Sooner or later

If you want to see blood
My love, here, it flows for you
And if I want to see well
Then I don't look
But dream of you
Nightfall has no mercy
Stay with me
West of the sun

Pull me towards you
Even if only for a moment
Because I can't leave now
Not until I've written and said
That the knives are sharpened
This pain is real

If you want to see blood
My love, here, it flows for you
And if I want to see well
Then I don't look
But dream of you
Nightfall has no mercy
Stay with me
West of the sun



I preferred to be alone
Put your arms around me
Move that one stone
Wrap your legs around me
And bring me in to you

If you want to see blood
My love, here, it flows for you
And if I want to see well
Then I don't look
But dream of you

If you want to see blood
My love, here, it flows for you
And if I want to see well
Then I don't look
But dream of you
Nightfall has no mercy
Stay with me
West of the sun <|endoftext|> 
There are no misunderstandings tonight
I know it is good
Ships burn better than you thought
I know it is good

Can you sing then sing
If you want to jump, jump
Don't do things in your head

You take my past to the limit
I know it is good
Exceeded, you are only human
I know it is good

Can you sing then sing
If you want to jump, jump
Don't do things in your head



You will be sorry tomorrow
You will be sorry tomorrow
Plenty of time and you still have concerns
You will be sorry tomorrow

Ships burn better than you thought
I know it is good

Can you sing then sing
If you want to jump, jump
Don't do things in your head
You will be sorry tomorrow

Plenty of time and you still have concerns

You will be sorry tomorrow
You will be sorry tomorrow
You will be sorry tomorrow
Plenty of time and you still have concerns

I know it is good <|endoftext|> 
Rain (part of Umoja)

(* Some gibberish *)

The dust is everywhere.
I can't get it away anymore.
Even if I take a bath for days.
It clings to me.
Still I don't feel dirty
because rain falls on my skin.

* Chorus *
This is a life
like everyone's.
Signed and alone,
and always disagree.
Of always disconnected,
through the unearned wages.
Got it by accident,
but the rain washes it clean.

The earth settles down,
she won't let me go anymore.
Under my nails black edges,
and sand at my feet.
Still I don't feel dirty
because rain falls on my skin.

*Chorus*
This is a life
like everyone's.
Signed and alone,
and always disagree.
Of always disconnected,
through the unearned wages.
Got it by accident,
but the rain washes it clean.

(* Some gibberish *)

Strike my name away
From your booklet of addresses
Lots of fives, more sixes
Now that I open up everything
Now that I can confess everything
Do you still have to get used to it
That what I say is true
Strike my name away
Don't browse anymore
In the album with portraits
And dried bouquets yellowed
Just put me down now
Just put me aside
Like a book from earlier times
Because you only read it once
Don't browse anymore
Lies are so beautiful
So quiet and enigmatic
As long as they are still themselves
As long as you believe them
Let them rest in your head
Because the truth only hurts
Don't browse anymore
In your diary and your notebooks
All pencils and markers
Never wrote anything down
That you can now give guidance
That let you survive now
Do what I say again:
Strike my name away <|endoftext|> 
The map of who I am
Can't really be followed by anyone
A labyrinth so gray and big
That you are always swallowed up by it

My map is black and white
And therefore difficult to fathom
You are looking for a street, but a good opportunity
That it is not found by you

And you enable me to love ...

Paint me red
Give me the color of your passion
Paint me red
Give me the color of your passion

My person's map
Can't be read well by anyone
Because I am not who I seem
I am unreal in essence

The map of who I am
Can not be explained to anyone
Sometimes it is asked
But then I never know what to say



But you enable me to love ...

Paint me red
Give me the color of your passion
Paint me red
Give me the color of your passion (2x)

The map of my thoughts
Disintegrates into shreds
When I try to unfold it
My world is in danger

Paint me red
Give me the color of your passion
Paint me red
Give me the color of your passion (2x)

Paint me red! <|endoftext|> 
Mold on the walls,
the crack in the ceiling
Quarrel at the neighbors,
the smell of wet cardboard
The boxes empty bottles,
the piles of dirty laundry
Used coffee filters,
and a smelly mattress

Sweating anxiously,
my sheets are drenched
And always wanting to know
whether you think of me now
Slept through for months,
didn't want to go anywhere
Tossing and turning feverishly
and my hunger is not satisfied

But something is imminent
Something rustles in the air
I don't see any connections yet
But I feel a warm sigh

The plates from the sleeves,
the books off the shelf
The shivering roses,
because the heating knob was stuck
The knocked-out sink
from pissing early in the morning
And the never-emptied ashtray
stolen from the pub



The square glasses are broken
I stepped on it
I wanted to hang myself
when you left
But the rope wasn't that strong
so I didn't make it
And the gas was cut off
because I hadn't paid

But something is imminent
Something rustles in the air
I don't see any connections yet
But I feel a warm sigh

I always adore you
You're my silent rumor
I dream of distant lands
On the run together <|endoftext|> 
You won
You have me in front of you
Defenseless after all these years
I had started
To stop
With looking and staring
To your legs
To your hands
To the line of your face
I can see your whole body
with my eyes closed

And more than ever
Am I ready for surrender
To you
Your will and your law
Take me to bed
Let's be soft
For each other



I'm lost
Broken my resistance
Defenseless after all these years
Reborn
Held up
With thinking and explaining
From your words
From your looks
Of the meaning of my existence
I can see your whole body
With the lights on

And more than ever
Am I ready for surrender
To you
Your will and your law
Take me to bed
Let's be soft
For each other
For each other

More than ever
Am I ready for surrender
To you
Your will and your law
Take me to bed
Let's be soft
More than ever
Am I ready for surrender
To you
Your will and your law
Take me to bed
Let's be soft
For each other ... <|endoftext|> 
Revolt (text: Peter Slager / music: Blíƒ¸f)

On stage
In a whirlwind of light
I'm melting
Copy of the sun
Shines straight to my face

And every décor changes
Every curtain closes
And every shelf creaks harder
Now that it's closer to me

In my head, in my hand
In my city and in my country
A rebellion brews the heart
And the mind
In my head, in my hand
In the core and on the edge
Breeds a rebellion of the heart and mind

Am I known
Or a stranger perhaps?
I tremble
When I realize
That I have to show something

And voices are now silent
Noise is silenced
And all my words are getting heavier
Now that it's getting closer to me



In my head, in my hand
In my city and in my country
A rebellion brews the heart
And the mind
In my head, in my hand
In the core and on the edge
Breeds a rebellion of the heart and mind

No air
No view
No question
No duty
Not a voice whispering in your ear
No care
No kiss
Not a word
Don't
Not a bang you hear in the distance

Listen to the wind with me
Be awake when it starts later

In my head, in my hand
In my city and in my country
A rebellion brews the heart
And the mind
In my head, in my hand
In the core and on the edge
Breeds a rebellion of the heart and mind <|endoftext|> 
Light enters me
She's standing next to me with her bag
As if something is opening
Something that wasn't there yet
And then I think, no, then I know
Even if it is only small
It is carved in stone
I don't have to be anywhere else

She looks at the clouds for a long time
And then she looks at me
As if she sees something new now
As if something appeared to her
And then she smiles (and then she smiles) and then she shines (and then she shines)
No one here is free
I just can't understand
How she can be herself

So open your eyes to me
Don't miss out on your luck

There is never anything in the stars
What a person does not understand well
As if any kind of explanation
Making it way too difficult
But you feel it and you see it
And you know it is
You cannot understand anymore
That you never missed a thing



So open your eyes to me
Don't miss out on your luck
Open your eyes to me
Don't miss out on your luck

Nothing special
Very easy
It happens all the time
Still a bolt of thunder
With a clear sky
Because today it happens to me
(Woo-oh)

Woo-oooh (4x)

Open your eyes to me
Don't miss out on your luck
Open your eyes to me
Don't miss out on your luck <|endoftext|> 
How far you go
Has nothing to do with distance
At most with time
And I don't know why
That I want to go
But it hits me hard and clean
And it persistently holds up
So here I am
With an outstretched hand

Sweet, then come along
And embrace me
Embrace me, embrace me
Sweet, then come along
And embrace me
Embrace me, embrace me
And don't take me anywhere

How deep you go
Has nothing to do with thinking
At most with a will
And it feels like I know
Where I'm going
And it leads me into the dark
And it mocks my mind
Here I am
With an outstretched hand



Sweet, then come along
And embrace me
Embrace me, embrace me
Sweet, then come along
And embrace me
Embrace me, embrace me
And don't take me anywhere

Sweet, then come along
Embrace my body and limb
Embrace my delusions
Embrace me, embrace me
Sweet, then come along
Embrace all of my past
Embrace my seven seas
Embrace me, embrace me
And don't take me anywhere

How upright you stand
Has nothing to do with heaviness
At most with the wind <|endoftext|> 
How far you go
has nothing to do with distance
At most with time


And I don't know why
that I want to leave
but it strikes me had and pure
and it stubbornly holds up
so here I stand with an outstretched hand


Dear, then come along and embrace me, embrace me, embrace me
Dear, then come along and embrace me, embrace me, embrace me
And don't take me anywhere


How deep you go
has nothing to do with thinking
At most with a will




And it feels like I know
where I'm going
and it leads me into the dark
and it mocks my mind
so here I stand with an outstretched hand


Dear, then come along and embrace me, embrace me, embrace me
Dear, then come along and embrace me, embrace me, embrace me
And don't take me anywhere


Dear, then come along, embrace my body and limbs
embrace my delusional ideas
embrace me, embrace me
then love come along, embrace all my past
embrace the seven seas
embrace me, embrace me
and don't take me anywhere


How upright you stand
has nothing to do with heaviness
at most with the wind <|endoftext|> 
You will visit me again
You come back to my door
You come to tell me again
What happened
Said among us
Keep quiet among us

You will visit me again
In the middle of the night
You come to tell me again
What you came up with
Said among us
And keep quiet among us
I run into you again and again
And you always end up here

Despite yourself, despite yourself
You keep coming back
And in spite of yourself, in spite of yourself
you keep coming back
But never for long

You will visit me again
But you don't like what I say
You come to drink with me again
But you also want to leave quickly
Done among us
And left among us
I love to hear you talk
And I don't like to see you go



Despite yourself, despite yourself
You keep coming back
And in spite of yourself, in spite of yourself
you keep coming back
But never for long

When I feel: you are coming
Then I already know, you will go again
Going nowhere, nowhere from anywhere

Despite yourself, despite yourself
You keep coming back
And in spite of yourself, in spite of yourself
you keep coming back
But never for long <|endoftext|> 
Dark and warm
I feel that my arm
Tense is next to you
Simple and good
You see what you do
And your calm amazes you
Everything stands still
For who knows what she wants
And you are such a person
The scent does its job
And you know that I notice
How you wait for the moment
Everything stands still
For who knows what he wants
And I am such a person
We are waiting face to face
Hey, are we leaving or are we staying here?
We are spinning face to face
Hey, are we going or are we staying here?
The heart in the throat
Not fear but through a lot
Too much blood running through my body
And gradually
Moves the mind
But we still know what drives us
Everything stands still
If you know what you want
And so it is now
We are waiting face to face
Hey, are we leaving or are we staying here?
We talk face to face
Until it's too late or not?
We are waiting face to face
Hey, are we leaving or are we staying here?
We talk face to face
Until it's too late or not? <|endoftext|> 
With every sun that rises
Drift further away from me
The sea seems calm
But appearances can be deceiving
The undertow is strong

I see as in a dream
That you beckoning to me
I don't have to save you
You are not a drowning person

Ooooohh
Everything in me
Impossibly turns red
Impossible red

With every sun that rises
You stay in your place in me
My blood seems calm
But appearances can be deceiving
The undertow is strong

I notice as in a dream
I'm not here
You don't have to wake me up
I am awake and aware



Ooooohhh
Everything in me
Impossibly turns red
Impossible red

Your face changes
But never completely disappears
The moon pulls the water
The tide is not turning for the better
And the storm picks up again

I notice as in a dream
I'm not here
You don't have to wake me up
I trust the undertow

Oooohhh
Everything in me
Impossibly turns red
Impossible red <|endoftext|> 
Quero ir-me embora,
o meu coracao deixar.
Por o seu veneno forums,
e de ti me curar.

And quero perder-te,
para de novo to ganhar.
E no labirinto das penas,
aprender a te amar.

Abrace-me, abrace-me e beija-me, deseja-me
Aperte-me verge forte contra ti.
Abrace-me, abrace-me e beija-me, deseja-me
E deixa-me um pouco morrer por ti

I'm not sorry anymore
of what I once told you.
From what I keep feeling
and what you don't feel for me.

Time really doesn't take a turn
things pass.
But the matters of the heart,
make me less and less free.

Don't speak of forgetting
don't talk about time.
Don't talk about later,
because later I lost.

Then hug me, then hug me
you know I can't live without it.
My heart is way too big
so now just gently squeeze me to death.

Then hug me, then hug me
you know I can't live without it.
But if I have to go without
then save me.

Diz-mo, quero ouvir,
o que nao te ouco mais dizer.
Quero fazer-te sentir,
que por ti espero.



Turning around you
I discover within myself.
I'm only half
half a man alone.

Quero fazer-te sofrer, nao por eu te querer mal
Mas por eu nao te poder dizer.
O quanto te quero.
Quero ver-te cair,
para te poder levantar
Da indiferenca te fazer sair, escutar-te chorar.

Then hug me, then hug me
you know I can't live without it
But if I have to go without
then save me.

Then hug me, then hug me

My heart is way too big

We stand still together
At the full moon
Who scatters silver on us
Something is about to happen
We can sense that
Although we never know what
You look at me smiling
It's like asking
Why you can trust me

Because it will be different
It's getting better than yesterday
more beautiful and more real
You will see it
Because it will be different
And it can be so much better

With your head held high
You stand in front of me
It's us and no one else
It won't be long
It comes down to it now
The sun is almost rising
You look at me smiling
It's like asking
Why you can trust me

Because it will be different
It's getting better than yesterday
more beautiful and more real
You will see it
Because it will be different
And it can be so much better

Tomorrow we will be far from here
We'll be gone tomorrow



Tomorrow we will be far from here
We'll be gone tomorrow

Tomorrow we will be far from here
We'll be gone tomorrow

Tomorrow we will be far from here
We'll be gone tomorrow

It gets more beautiful and real and bigger and better

You will see it
Because it will be different
It's getting better than yesterday
more beautiful and more real
You will see it
Because it will be different
And it can be so much better
You will see it
Because it will be different
You will see it
Because it will be different
Because it will be different <|endoftext|> 
I heard you are lonely
That your heart is now more of a fortress
Your code uncracked
I heard you're inside
That your night is too short again
And hit by the moon

Will you give up?
Won't you say anything back?
I can not stand that
I don't want to
The new moon is coming again
The new moon is coming again

I heard you sing songs
With a voice of pure gold
In a non-existent language
I heard you say nothing more
That you remain indifferently silent
An untold story

Will you give up?
Won't you say anything back?
I can not stand that
I don't want to
The new moon is coming again
The new moon is coming again



Will you give up?
Won't you say anything back?
I can not stand that
I don't want to
The new moon is coming again
The new moon is coming again <|endoftext|> 
Put your jacket of
Loosen your hair
Lie very still next to me

Focus on
Just touch me
Almost everything is too much now
Is too much now

I am nothing but this
I am nothing but this
I am nothing but this
What you envision

Take it clockwise
Put him wrong
Let the hands turn



Grab your shoes
Put them out of line
I'll keep the box
Until it is full

I am nothing but this
I am nothing but this
I am nothing but this
What you envision

Be still for a while
Just be like now
Be here for a while
And then close the door

I am nothing but this
I am nothing but this
I am nothing but this
What you envision <|endoftext|> 
October comes by surprise every year.
We look at each other after a crowded summer.
And we have changed again, but it no longer feels trustworthy.
Now that we suddenly realize that we are not ourselves.

In October.

October is the cruellest month, October.
With the things that pass.
But stuck somewhere.
They keep coming back to us.

Somewhere in October.

October comes by surprise every year.
We stay together after too short a summer.
And we have changed again, not for better or for worse.
But changed nevertheless.



In October.

October is the cruellest month, October
With the things that pass.
But stuck somewhere
They keep coming back to us.
And usually in October.
Usually in October. <|endoftext|> 
There you go again
Hit the same stone
Ask yourself for forgiveness
In the mirror on the toilet

Old and wise enough
But learned nothing yet
No more confidence
No more confidence

When will I be healed
Will I ever get over this?
Oh, the doctor says you're healthy
But baby I feel bad

refr .:
    I am addicted to you
    I can not live without you
    I am addicted to you
    I can't do anything with you anymore
    I am addicted to you
    Addicted to you



I wanted fresh air
A kiss from a golden morning sun
A clear sea
With a ship on the horizon

I lost my way
Where have I gone wrong
Friends say "you are quiet"
But dear I scream in my sleep

refr.

Addicted to you
I fell into your trap
Ohohohohohohoho
Ohohohohohohoho
Ohohohoooohohoooo
Ohohohoooohohoooo
I am addicted to you
I can't do anything without you
Addicted to you (I can't anymore)
I can't do anything with you anymore
I'm addicted to you (without you)
I can't do anything without you (without you)
Addicted to you (I can't anymore)
I can't do anything with you anymore <|endoftext|> 
And those businessmen there
They don't know
How laughable they are
Watch them stare at you
And you pretend they're not there

And that pale girl there
He is sad
She is waiting for her boyfriend
He went with the sailors
And then he was not seen again

I want to get drunk with you
Being drunk with you
Until it becomes light
And we fight against time

And the band is finished
The party is over
To great sadness
They played the wrong song
And the public did not understand



And stand outside
The beggars
Drunks and night owls ready
To bring in their loot
From the guests of
The disappeared bridal couple

If only I could get drunk with you
Being drunk with you
And suddenly there is the miracle
Of not being alone anymore
If only I could get drunk with you
Being drunk with you
But to get drunk together
There must be confidence

Come a little closer
Read my hand and tell me
Who I am, how much longer I have to go
As long as you stay with me
Stay with me

If only I could get drunk with you
Drunk at the end
But to get drunk together
There must be confidence

There must be trust
There must be trust <|endoftext|> 
(Frank Boeijen and Wout Pennings)

I sit inside and they walk out in the rain
Sometimes looking up and vaguely remembering me
I've been maimed, changed and my face
And only real friends still recognize me

refr .:
    It is wrong to look back
    It makes things look nicer
    Sometimes I don't feel at home in the present
    And then rather live
    Oh I'd rather live in the past
    Oh wowowoh
    Wowowohoh



Sunbeams on the face I know so well
Mirror on the wall and see who I am
You come again at night and I was not expecting you
But you came anyway, you still wanted me

refr.

Close my eyes, the world will turn
I hear you far away when you say something
Oh, if you say something and you have sometimes
Such a small, soft, sweet queen in your bed
Often the next day an old hard witch
And you sit in your chair and you have that feeling
And you know what I mean
To stuff everything up, a hidden desire <|endoftext|> 
It is so cozy here, so nice
And everyone wonders
Where the rest would be
Are they invited?
Or did you not think that was necessary
Otherwise give them a call
Maybe they will come

There are now about five men
At this American party
So take it
A case of beer, a bag of peanuts
And three bottles of Coca-Cola

All those stories about so and so
And she's got some and he
has nothing
and I can't talk anymore
My tongue is stuck
I have to go out
I'm so fed up

refr .:
    Oh, I never want to
    To a Birthday Party
    Because they are annoying
    To be annoying
    At least I agree
    Been a thousand
    I never want again
    I'm never going again
    To a birthday party



Quiet couples for the
Fireplace
This is romantic
This is worth gold
It looks like a rest cure
A minute lasts an hour
Staring, staring into that fire

You wake up with a start, suddenly
You discover someone there
run off with your girlfriend
You can hear them laughing upstairs
slumped through the bed
I have to go out, it's me
sat here

refr.

Tell me it's nice here
Tell me I'm having fun
Pretend it's fun here
This is the last time,
I'm never going again
I never want to ... <|endoftext|> 
You're right
That was a difficult time
I don't know what I was doing

Or actually
Or actually
Maybe I had the idea

That before
It was too late
Everything had to be done
That before
It was too late
Everything had to be done

Just everything at once, everything at the same time
A crusade against injustice
In the time that remains

But that I was forgetting you
Was forgotten
I did not think about that



That before
It was too late
Everything had to be done
That before
It was too late
Forgiveness is a big word

And big words are lonely
Big words are lonely

You say we are stronger
Stronger than the wind
You say we are stronger
Stronger
Stronger than the wind

Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Is a big word
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Is a big word <|endoftext|> 
Had dinner last night
In a chic hotel a little further
Beautifully situated
High above the horizon

Then a lot of work done
On the porch
At the oil lamp
By the rushing sea

Letters written
D.H. Lawrence
Women in Love
Heard the wind
Heard the crickets
Thought about life
From

Forbidden poets
With forbidden dreams
Forgotten scandals
Misunderstood in their time

How much I care about you
How much credit you give me
And despite everything
You stay with me

Our unknown love
Connected to one another
By that angel
Who watches over us



Soon I'll be lying next to you
And ask: what do you dream of
In secret
Of the night

While the fishermen pray
For a good catch
And I keep dreaming
From

Forbidden poets
With forbidden dreams
Forgotten scandals
Misunderstood in their time
Condemned by the good taste
Hushed up, silenced
And eventually died
In beauty

While at home
The friends are drinking
To victory
From David to Goliath
And here the revolution breaks out
They say, 'Hey man, it's like sixty-eight'

I offer some words
I offer a melody
I offer to the gods
From

Forbidden poets
With forbidden dreams
Forgotten scandals
Misunderstood in their time <|endoftext|>

If the trapdoor
The trap opens up
You sleepwalk
And the drunkard
Speaks out drunk
Then you stammer

And life
Magic a rabbit
Out of the hat
On your hands
Sticks blood
Where were you last night

And the cat is looking for contact
In your dreams it is
Not just alone
A pet in a haunted house
Only two eyes
With a questioning look



And again for a while
Life puts you
In the corner
You know that
Too good
Where were you last night

In the slaughterhouse
From feelings
Are the blades sharpened
To the bone
The question went away
Where were you last night

Very far out in the universe
A woman embraces a man
Entwined in one
Stone wedding couple
On the way to the altar

And the morning
Sticks his neck through the window
Where are you from
Where were you last night
Where were you last night
Where were you last night
Where were you last night <|endoftext|> 
Two men so quiet
Hand in hand
At a funeral
From a friend

Give a handkerchief
Don't tell anyone
A reservoir of tears
Pushes out time

What is grief
Is it an enemy or a friend
Let's go dance
Until it no longer works
Until dawn

Two men so quiet
Hand in hand
Saying goodbye
From a friend

They storm the sky
They disappear into the night
They run and they drink
They laugh at the impotence



What is grief
Is it an enemy or a friend
Let's go dance
Until it no longer works

It's a fair in hell
It rains while the sun is shining
On the other side of the world
How would it be at home now?

The sun broke through the horizon
The waves keep coming
The palm trees along the beach
The fishermen in their boats

Traveling keeps you moving
But now you stopped
Now you stand still
With the past

Motherland, waterland
Fatherland, without a father
Now that I think of you, so far away
Where it rains in the water

A man kneels in the mosque
And somewhere a rooster is crowing
Soon the prayers will begin
And everyone wakes up

A mother washes her child
In the foaming water
The fishermen return
With stories for later

Traveling keeps you moving
But now you stopped
Now you stand still
With the past

Motherland, waterland
Fatherland, without a father
Now that I think of you, so far away
Through the rain, through the water



Cloud land, gray land
Winterland, skating land
Tree land, ditch land
Green land, proud land

And the sun will set here again
Then the sky is on fire
Can you see the smoke, can you see the smoke
There in my

Motherland, motherland
Fatherland, without a father
Now that I think of you, so far away
Through the rain, through the water

Motherland, motherland
Homeland, country of birth

Rich country, small country

Polderland, new land
Promised land, no man's land
Free country, Iceland
Sandy land, river land

Millland, farmland
City country, road country

Grassland, marshy land
Coastal land, tulip land
Dijkenland, clay island
Maasland, drowned land

Dune land, economical land
Coffee country, cheese country
Amsterdam, Rotterdam

Hollow land, full land
Wet land, cold land
My country, your country
Our country
Native country <|endoftext|> 
We came a long way
Through city and country
We said goodbye
With a broken heart
And in the night the last song was heard
You stood there and didn't understand
The children were hungry
And were scared
We had to go
Away from the flat land
And in the mountains I lost track
It was in the mountains that I lost them

refr .:
    Goodbye - no one knows
    Goodbye - where you disappeared
    Farewell



For who knows what love is
For who knows what losing is
Are these words
Straight from the heart
Pronounced by
A desperate man

Suzanne takes you
To a bank on the water
A thousand ships pass
And yet it does not get later
And you know she's great
Because that's why you're sitting next to her
And she gives you mints
Because she likes to give you something tangible
And just when you want to tell her
I can't give you love
The whole city comes to life
And you can hear seagulls screaming
You have always loved her

refr .:
    And you want to go with her
    Together to the other side
    And you have to trust her
    Because she holds all your thoughts in her hand



And Jesus was a fisherman
Who trusted the water so much
That he just walked across the sea
Because he had learned to love
From the waves and the surf
In which no one can drown
He said, "If you keep believing
Can't sink the heaviest stone "
But heaven just opened
When his body was broken
And how he suffered
Only the fisherman on the cross knows that

refr.

Suzanne takes you
To a bank on the water
You remember what she looks at
As a reminder for later
And the sunlight is like honey
What children enjoy
And the lawn is littered
With what people do away with
The heroes lie in the gutter
With a smile on your lips
And the seagulls in the sky
Look like stray dots
When Suzanne looks at you smiling <|endoftext|> 
Nobody knows
Or could have imagined
But I fear it is true
You have two faces

You never look at me
Right in my eyes
Afraid of betrayal
You have two faces

One is bright warm and open
One is dark closed and cold

Tell me what face
Tell me what it is
The true face of you



The truth sometimes hurts
The truth sometimes surfaces
What am I supposed to believe
You have two faces

And when I see you
What am I supposed to tell you
That I know it's true
You have two faces

One is bright warm and open
One is closed dark and cold

Tell me what face
Tell me what it is
The true face of you
What is the true face of you <|endoftext|>

Would you do that?

    And you don't know what to do
    Broken your heart

Give me your hands
Give me your mouth
Surrender to me

I will carry you
I'll be there
If you are sick or lonely
Or let down

How can I change
How can I say this
That tomorrow
I'm leaving you

How the people walk
Upright on the street
Without
To fall

How do the birds fly
From here to there
Why don't you say a word to me
And what have I done

How does the last glass taste
Only at the bar
Everyone has disappeared
It is quiet in the city



What are you afraid of
How far do I have to go
So deep
So deep within you

What will happen there
What do you find there
In the dark
Of the past

And you see your mother's mouth
Breathing in the cold
And if you listen very carefully
She sings a song to you

A song full of desire
A song full of pain
And years later
It will be quiet in the city
It will be quiet in the city

It will be quiet in the city
It will be quiet in the city <|endoftext|>

    Along the mountains
    Through the valleys
    When the sun has set



This is the last day
The time has been here
But not without thinking
To that land on the North Sea
Where people hold their own
Under a gray sky
Where people work
And where people are strong
But sometimes forgets to live

While the power is gathering desperately
Everything is darkened
In the streets of the city

And the middle class blind their shop windows
While soldier after soldier gathers
In the dark on the outskirts of the city

And not in Tehran or Prague
But here in Holland in a city
rebellion

And who has not yet understood it
You fight against your own army

Puppets of authority

Slaves of love

I have no pride
I have no heart
And beware
I write for the newspaper

And you
You lying next to me now
You must go
Tell me what the bill is

Slaves of love
Fools of love
Slaves of love
Slaves of love
Fools of love
Slaves of love <|endoftext|> 
Drink coffee, smoke a cigarette
The wind blows, the sun turns me
And then evening falls in the Zuiderzee
Stop reading a bad book
Try a song
Listen to the old singer
There is life, no sorrow

refr .:
    The world, the world is different
    Life, life changes
    Since the day God has been declared dead
    Since the day God has been declared dead

Do you love next door love
Look for rare words
For the same feeling
That you ever lost
Visit, experience the muse
And learn to wait again
And find a melody in the gray of your mind



refr.

The trail remains rigid
Time is racing on and on
Who shows the way
Who says it

Can be seen at dawn
And the * in your mind
And love becomes tangible
And I want to disappear into your arms <|endoftext|> 
Hey those words of someone else,
only When they rest in a melody,
When they rest in song,
Rather they are not my words
Are they really my words (are they really not my words)

In the house where I once lived
Suddenly my suitcases were ready,
I just came in
Maybe a little too late
Okay, way too late
But only the 4th time that year.

And on that night in mid-January,
She looked at me, said
“Do you understand? “,
I took them
And asked shyly
It was very inconvenient,
If I would just use the toilet for a while.

[Chorus]

Once in a country I drove through
Am often happy, but never for long
Next to me on the chair the phone
Was unusual for the time,
And I don't like that, then I get scared.



know them know the words
but it's like being numbed
someone said you left us
did not notice it himself
but have them to your song that's really never normal

[Chorus]

only when peace has really come
And I've got pen, paper and wine
Only then when I have translated them,
determined my own order,
Have you gone or will I never be with me again?

[Chorus]

It might be the right words
But where are the chords <|endoftext|> 
Do you feel how I come to you?
You are naked at night.
Wait, I'll put on a cloth first.
Not yet, not yet.

Caress me, soft.
Tell me you like me
And only by caressing
In the dark, see me.



We will play
That who laughs first
Must undergo
What the other came up with?

Oh let it go on
Until we die.
Everything that comes after this
Is nothing but Death, disguised
In Semblance of Life.

Take me again, wait a second <|endoftext|> 
I can't do everything
But what I'm doing now I can do very well
I look at you how you sleep
And how damn beautiful you do it
I can't do everything, that's okay
This is already a lot
Just leave me next to you
This is what I can do
And I can do this well
This is what i want
And this is all I have to do

I can't do everything
But what I'm doing now I can do very well
I think about everything that went wrong today
And how to improve

Maybe better tomorrow
See if it could be more fun tomorrow
Sometimes I suddenly forget
Why I want everything
Because I want to
But I can't keep it up
Because everything gets used much too quickly

I don't want to get used to you
Never, ever, ever let me get used to you



I can't do everything
But what I do now I really enjoy doing
I turn off the light, crawl next to you
It was enough today

Tell me once, my love
What was so nice about me again
Sometimes I suddenly forget
That I love you so
And can no longer live without it
When everything, everything gets used
Soon I'll get used to this too

I don't want to get used to you
Never, ever, ever let me get used to you

You get used to everything
All the sweet, evil and fun besides <|endoftext|> 
Welcome back

You take the stairs
Hangs your coat
See me at the window
I look up and smile
I find your hand, your head
Everything back
It would be nice, wouldn't it?

If you were here last night
Where you will dance
And I'll sing
You caress and you will drink
I will whisper
And you will shout from the rooftops
A tiny bit will die
Will be back

See my love what I'm doing
This is the game I play
From when you left until tomorrow
And it helps me so much



Do you too
Take the stairs
Your coat, the window
I catch you, smile

Kiss me, I kiss you
Now hang up
I see you tomorrow
But for now
Goodnight
Welcome back <|endoftext|> 
Sweet, don't be afraid
It will be fine
You can't hear me now but trust
Trust in love
That you feel
I love as much as you feel now
I love you

Daddy-papa-papapa-papaaaaa
Daddy-daddy
Daddy-papa-papapa-papaaaaa

What went wrong?
I think the years
Good for too many years too long.
You can do the dance
Long spring
Until the moment and that is now
That you should dance

Daddy-papa-papapa-papaaaaa
Daddy-daddy
Daddy-papa-papapa-papaaaaa



But don't be afraid
It will be fine
It seems cold and colder than it is
I often think about you
And how you are at home
You think of me
And what do I do?
And who do I miss?

Daddy-papa-papapa-papaaaaa
Daddy-daddy
Daddy-papa-papapa-papaaaaa <|endoftext|> 
I would like to tell you
What's going on in my head
Would someone tell me
I never would have believed it
I left alone
Left a note 'wait for me'
Three carefree words
Belongs to a distraught
I would like to tell you
What's haunting my brain
But those who are honest in everything will be lonely

I would like to tell you
But I don't know how
Sometimes I want to try
But I never get around to it
I'm just turning around the truth
Also because I don't really know them
Leaving seemed the simplest
Away from all that I am

I would like to tell you
What's haunting my brain
But those who are honest in everything will be lonely
I want to be honest in everything but not lonely



But wait for me
I'm coming
As always, as always
Too late

And I lied through life
And until yesterday it went well
Will you tell me where it went wrong?
If I know how to proceed

I just ask wait for me
It can only get better
I want to be honest in everything
And then be allowed to stand next to you

Wait for me
I'm coming
As always, as always
Too late <|endoftext|> 
I do not know what it is
But I want it
I think it can do something
So let that do what it can
Do that for me
I do not know what it is
But it looks really great
To buy!
And we'll see what it's for

I do not know what it is
But I need it
They throw if it's nothing
Really not such a thing
In such an expensive folder
I do not know what it is
But I can afford it!
To buy!
And we'll see what it does

What I see I must have
What I need is .......
Nowhere to be seen

I do not know what it is
But it is useful
useful and besides it is
much better than that other thing
That other thing was beautiful
But no longer works very well
Or yes, but this is better
I want it!
I want it too! I want it now.

What I see I must have
What I need is .......
Nowhere to be seen




Of course I know what it is
Or what you are going to say
It's nothing, it's air
It's compensation
Emptiness, luxury, surrogate
Of course I know what it is
But love is too expensive
Things are always too expensive
If one does not say what it costs

Things are always expensive
If you are not told what it costs <|endoftext|> 
I've done something new
I did something terrible new.
I hung the wall with all the photos I have of you, and I stood in front of it and then ...

Did I make music
Made strange music.
For the first time struck a chord that makes me happy and then my love,
Only then did I dare to ask my heart to sing about you dear.
This is my first happy song
And it doesn't get much deeper anymore
Then enough for a chorus.
I'm too busy being happy again!

I've done something new
I did something terrible new.
I was on my way to another song like: Oh my god I let go of love, but then ...

Did I make music
Made strange music.
For the first time struck a chord that makes me happy and then my love,
Did I know that if I wanted to be sad I really had to force myself sweet ...
This is my first happy song
And it doesn't get much deeper anymore
Then enough for a chorus.
I'm too busy being happy again!



Oh, and if I don't succeed.
Luckily I've already been lucky
Luckily I have been happy already.
More than enough for a chorus,
I'm too busy being happy again!

Oh, oh and if I don't succeed
Luckily I've already been lucky
Luckily I have been happy already.
More than enough for a chorus,
Be happy again ..

I did something new .. <|endoftext|> 
Where were you?
when I called you
you later told me i was in town with friends
there was something else, a party
and there you would have been.

Then what did you do?
When you heard me and I interrupted your game
of the butterfly in the night
you said too softly don't
now just sleep and a kiss

And I know I wouldn't claim you
wasn't going to make any problems
when the going got tough
and I know I would let you
I would never, ever leave you
But that it became difficult, so difficult became who ever expected it?



But where did you go?
when I waited expecting you in my bed
I had set the alarm because you would still come
but where were you now?
where were you now? 2x

I'm going to break here and I just wait and you laugh everything well
I'm here anyway
I'm with you anyway and we make out all right

But where were you then?
when I kissed you your faded eyes
kissed your sweaty cheeks
I don't know what you were thinking
but what I think now
and what I can't do much longer
love dear dear where are you then?
where are you then (3x) <|endoftext|> 
The sun in your eyes, the wind in your hair
a smile on your lips
like saying "it's just me"

You roam around the room
you dance through my life
you sing through the windows
which in my breath
your name is written



You are like the earth, you want to give it to me
all the days of this beautiful life
I wait and see you open up
in the rays of the sun
In the rain you will grow
I wait and see you open up
I told you I could wait
I see you shine in the sun

sometimes unbelievable, sometimes unavoidable
sometimes just deny sometimes just do something
just hear your voice in the receiver
just your hands, just a kiss
and then peace again, autumn has come again
and then again on your back, autumn has already gone
winter is needed to come together
then you want spring again, then you laugh at me

You are like the earth, you want to give it to me
all the days of this beautiful life
I wait and see you open up
in the rays of the sun
In the rain you will grow
I wait and see you open up
I told you I could wait
I see you shine in the sun
I see you shine in the sun <|endoftext|> 
For you I exist
after all these years i am going
still blind
for you

I long for you
you give a finger and then I hang
like a child
to you

for you heaven and earth
for you the stars and the moon
you get it how you want it
it will exist for you

I'm leaving with you
you will call me and then I will pull
me back to you

in you I lose
and I have to search and then I see
me back again
in you



For you the days and the nights
For you only for you from now on
you get me how you want me
If you don't want me I'll go

And will I sing the time when everything was good
And will I sing the time when everything was good

For you a house to live in
for you a tile to stand
For you a word to believe
half a word to understand

Because of you I believe
I want so badly and so I promise
again too much
by you
I'm making up for you
with you I start ...
I love you
sink into you
I drink to you
and I turn
and I'll do it
and I win you
never really
for me

I sing a song for you
and if you don't want to
I don't sing <|endoftext|> 
A Sir
sits with a lady on a terrace
She is crying and he is angry
He shouts
She doesn't answer his question
And her tears are too late
Then he dives into his bag
And she knows she's going to die
He has pictures taken from afar
Which states
What she did with whom where

How did the Vondelpark smell last night?
He keeps asking
He wants to know
How did the Vondelpark smell last night?

A girl is sitting alone on the terrace
And a boy wants to go with her
He is writing
Always a new sentence on his newspaper
And then she shakes her head again

Then he hears further on
The man who keeps asking the same thing
He writes: 'how does the Vondelpark smell tonight?'
And has wiped out her armor



How did the Vondelpark smell last night?
He laughs, she nods
She wants to know
How did the Vondelpark smell last night?

A boy is sitting alone on the terrace
And smokes a cigarette happily
He has the people of like
And put their lyrics in rhyme

And I'm behind him
And also put him on the paper
Then I pay and leave
There are too many songwriters here

How did the Vondelpark smell last night
What does it matter? Who cares?
How did the Vondelpark smell last night?
To forest, what would you have thought ?!
How did the Vondelpark smell last night?
How did the Vondelpark smell last night? <|endoftext|>

I haven't done anything at all today
Only had breakfast, ate a sandwich
And closed coffee in my stomach
Now it is half past four, some grip in my body again
And my God how time slipped today
I feel lazy as in a dream
The whole world is moving so slowly
Even the telephone is not completely on tone

ahaaaa
And if I answer (if I answer)
Wrongly connected (wrongly connected)
So I don't answer anymore
I'll lick my wounds myself today

I dreamed of you last night
And we played that we shared everything
Your voice was a little too soft
Didn't understand what you said: nananana still mine



And then we danced tonight
Ten years older, head to shoulder
I really didn't expect it anymore
Thought I was lucky
But my shoulder got so wet

ahaaaa
And if I answer (if I answer)
Wrongly connected (wrongly connected)
So I don't answer anymore
I'll lick my wounds myself today

I'm going to look for you tonight
And I will talk in all the streets
With everyone who smiles at me
Or look at me or look just a bit like you
And I know I'll find you tonight
And I'm taking you home
You will laugh, you will be home
The day has been saved again
Because I dream you in my bed

ahaaaa
And if I answer (if I answer)
Wrongly connected (wrongly connected)
So I don't answer anymore
I'll lick my wounds myself today
aaaaaaaahhhaaahhhhaaaaaaa
So I don't answer anymore
I'll lick my wounds myself today <|endoftext|> 
You can never stand quietly on a pedestal.
You have just stood quietly on your pedestal or the people are already arriving,
brandishing scythes, axes, shouting, "What are you doing up there!"
You can never stand quietly on a pedestal here.

You can never stand quietly on a pedestal.
You score 2-1 in the final, a nice plinth is chosen.
You are just standing there as if someone asks, "How did your marriage go wrong?"
You can never stand quietly on a pedestal here.


There is only one thing more beautiful than a hero. (1 thing more beautiful than) 2X
There is only one thing more beautiful than a hero, that's the beautiful hero felled.
Beautiful hero felled.


You can never stand quietly on a pedestal.
You find the right medicine, people shout, great, well done.
But if we weren't very sick first, you would never have gone looking.
You can never stand quietly on a pedestal here.

You can never stand quietly on a pedestal.
You were the first on the moon, damn it just come from.
Then there will always be a child, he cannot leave the bottle.
You can never stand quietly on a pedestal here.


There is only one thing more beautiful than a hero. (1 thing more beautiful than) 2X
There is only one thing more beautiful than a hero, that's the beautiful hero felled.




The great thing about its pedestal, should you ever step on it.
People saw your paws anyway, hope you will screw it up again.
The great thing about its pedestal, should you ever step on it.
You can see your enemy coming here much better than there with you below.


There is only one thing more beautiful than a hero. (1 thing more beautiful than) 2X
There is only one thing more beautiful than a hero, and that's the beautiful hero. <|endoftext|> 
Damn Kees, it's been a year today
That you are buried
It is strange how quickly you get used to that
Because God you know, I really liked you
I knew what you got from you
Well, what do you call that
Except that I miss you a little bit
Well, my way
Everything is the same here
Don't think, Kees, that a lot has changed
A minor thing at most
In barely 1 year
There is still star advertising
And with the political names
Is there 1 new: Drees
And there are intercity trains
And you have other curtains
Got it, I fear, Kees



Damn Kees, a year is a long time
If you don't see each other
I actually do not know
It all just goes as usual
And it turns, I think
Here also without you
karel miegels still writes in het Parool
And the Apollo's go
Still to the moon
Oh yes, your daughter is going to school now
And your son next year
But hey, that's quite normal
And yet when I hear myself talking like that
Gaps suddenly appear
Between my clichés
Because your roses no longer bloom
Because they don't spray enough
That says something, I fear, Kees

Damn Kees, I don't know anymore
Always remember what you said
It all passes
And that the time of life again and again
Just started over
Nothing new under the sun
But that's not true, because you were just you
You wandered around here
And that is never repeated
When I see your house, you belong there
And next to a children's bicycle
I miss something too
But there is nothing else to report
Oil is still floating on the Scheldt
There are still cafes
And further I heard a moment ago
Alongside the song: Long will she live
Great, I fear, Kees <|endoftext|> 
Everyone gone
I am the most shocked when I say so
But I'd rather they go
Don't want to play tonight
And don't entertain anyone
And also like to skip tomorrow

Everyone gone
"I'm really sorry to say it
But I have dark in my head
Bumped into someone this afternoon
Got the bill
Of what I thought was promised to me as free

And I know, I know
It always comes to an end
You are only allowed to enjoy something
If you let it pass too

And I know, I know
It always comes to an end
You are only allowed to enjoy something
Just enjoy something
If you promise you'll ever let it pass
Done today

Everyone gone
Leave me alone and you will see
Will I be able to use it again later?
"IT is just one of those things
Which I could sing for years
Without ever thinking about it



I saw it again as I sang a thousand times
Page eighteen at the bottom
It didn't matter that he was gone
Too long ago for real grief
But it happened to me like that
The ease with which your name could have been there

And I know, I know
It always comes to an end
You are only allowed to enjoy something
If you let it pass too
And I know, I know
It always comes to an end
You are only allowed to enjoy something
If you let it pass too

And I know, I know
It always comes to an end
You are only allowed to enjoy something
Just enjoy something
If you promise you'll ever let it pass
If you promise you'll ever let it pass

Done today <|endoftext|> 
Had heard a lot of it
And almost every story was beautiful
And suppose such a story found us
Prepared us very well
And suddenly the time had come
We were tight on whatever awaited us

We get cards, all stones
The pawns and our money
Maybe even won the coin toss
you can't go back
Take one more deep breath
And then, just before it starts
We hear somewhere in the distance
'the golden rule'
Golden rule? what was it again?

Here's the game
Here are the rules
And now bend with those rules until you win

We are enjoying the game
And we feel that stories
How beautiful it could be even more beautiful
Take off the coats, here we go again
The rulers of the field
Every gain feels big, loss doesn't feel too small

And then suddenly, miscalculated?
Not paying attention or what?
Are we behind ?! Yes, and far, as you can see
We shout: Hey, something is going wrong
But everyone else shouts: no!
It's just the golden rule
'the golden rule'
Golden rule? Yes, not one more line




Here's the game
Here are the rules
And now bend with those rules until you win

So! That was the golden rule
We weren't really expecting
And we lose again and some more
And now we are faced with the choice
Are we going to do? You wanted to play!
Come on! Roll, slide, put those cards down!

It's a rule, golden rule
Because he is later than the others
Because it was even invented later than the game

Here's the game
Here are the rules
And now bend with those rules until you win <|endoftext|> 
Today I went for a walk
I've been planning it for months
But only when everyone said it couldn't be done
I walked
Watch me walk anyway

Here I walk

Today I went for a walk
I have counted the opinions
And have figured out that it doesn't matter
Even if you don't find anything
Even that is still being told as an opinion

Today I went for a walk
And where I walk is a road from now on

Today I went for a walk
I shrink with every sound
I am much more scared than I was
When I was still standing still
May be so
But I'm finally coming
I am finally moving forward



Today I went for a walk
And where I walk is a road from now on
Watch me run, 7 locks
Highest mountains the other way around
I started walking anyway
I'll see where I go

Deep valleys, beautiful paths
I glow softly at what I do
says in an almost inaudible whisper

Where I've walked
Is off a road from now on

Today I went for a walk
Because that's what I wanted
Have no idea why they said it couldn't be done
Better say go, that's nice
And you should do it

'Cause look at me laughing man

Here I am walking now <|endoftext|> 
Beautiful
I also saw how beautiful the sun was
But more for someone else
And what that could do to the other

O 'I saw how beautiful the sun was
But never saw what to do in a song
(until I get you)
Until I saw you I didn't see that

Beautiful
I also saw how beautiful the night was
But more for myself
More just for me alone

O 'I saw how beautiful the night was
But I never saw what to do
in song
(until I get you)
Until I saw you I didn't see that



O 'I saw how beautiful the night was
But for me it was a night and nothing more
(until I get you)
Until I saw you I didn't

Beautiful,
I knew how beautiful the rain was
I was so cool
So clean up
Take everything with you and rinse away
I can take her

I felt the coolness of the rain

O 'I felt how cool the rain
I ran away from everything but not that
(until I get you)
But only then did I have a song
It wasn't until I got you that I had a song
Until I get you <|endoftext|> 
I read a book in which a man spent his life
waiting for a woman
for a lifetime you not on me I not on you
I heard a song where a woman doesn't get what she'd like
say what you want say it to me or I'll write a song like that for you now
But it doesn't stay the way it is, you never want to see it again
It's no fun, it's not sweet, maybe not even a solution

But:
Out of sight out of mind
Out of mind, out of mind
Out of mind, out of mind
I hope for that
But the first was promised to me
Out of sight out of mind
out of mind, out of mind

Someone told a story he instantly became my best friend
About the love of which two and more no one was served
There was no future and no time only that love that never faded
Before lust would destroy them they did what you didn't do to me

At night without a suitcase to Paris
two compartments far from each other
they both had the address
we don't say anything I'll see you there
three nights are those two
finished the room once
they just got to the corner
they looked but it was party time again
three nights long, three nights of sex
and between tears and again
a lifetime must on weekends
I've got the cards for that



But it doesn't stay the way it is, you never want to see it again
It's no fun, it's not sweet, maybe not even a solution

But:
Out of sight out of mind
Out of mind, out of mind
Out of mind, out of mind
I hope for that
But the first was promised to me
Out of sight out of mind
out of mind, out of mind

I hope for the second sentence
But the first was promised to me

Time (untitled)

Time for love
Time for hope
Time for a rest and oh, it sounds so cheap
But respect sir

Time for peace, just sing it
Because it sounds like it is something from the past
But I can no longer

I know a man like you has heard what I sing before
But they are words that everyone has misused by you and me

I sing it as clear as I can
Both in the Bible, Torah and Koran
Are those words real
Love it that you believe something
What was promised by a man from the past
But you read so badly



I know a man like you has heard what I sing before
But they are words abused by everyone, by everyone

We hope you had a nice evening
We were pleased that you were there
We hope you had a nice evening
And that you weren't reading anything else
Love, hope, respect and peace, tranquility
Just so you know
I'm not asking
I don't demand it
I'm way past begging
But take them with you, sir

I know a man like you has heard what I sing before
But your God gave me strength I made up the same words

We hope you had a nice evening
We were pleased that you were there
We hope you had a nice evening
And that you weren't reading anything else
Words
Don't kill
Words
Don't kill <|endoftext|> 
Suppose we do,
Suppose we really,
So suppose I'm really here with you
Can you please
Dear I really can't get it done.
Not that I don't, I that I
Oh my god I can't get it out.
Suppose we do,
Suppose we really,
That's weird!

Suppose we do,
Maybe you and I can
So imagine,
So that we together,
So you and me, stop it!
How can a human, what do you say?
I know a lot I didn't make it up
You came and turned everything upside down.

(Suppose we do)
What do you suppose it is a question asked by you, I can hope it is not say .. a fish
(Suppose we do)
Since you thought you know what I do I just throw it on because I love the great panic now,
You knew that
You knew that.

You knew!



Suppose we do,
Suppose we really,
So suppose I'm really here with you
Can you, love I really can't get it done.
Not that I don't, I that I, Oh my god I can't get it out!
Suppose we do suppose we really that is weird, isn't it?

Anyway,
Back to your question,
Suppose we do not suppose
Would you, As you asked me
So I would, then I say ... Hush!
You had a question
You wanted an answer, okay
That's what you get now
My god I can't but the answer is
I want ... I do ...

(Suppose we do)
What do you suppose it is a question asked by you, I can hope it is not say .. a fish
(Suppose we do)
Since you thought you know what I do I just throw it on because I love the great panic now,
You knew that
You knew that!

Was against better judgment
Waiting for a new sentence
But everything that came had been said before
Maybe not because of me but just as bad
Searched for the moment in mind
The most beautiful thing I ever knew
When I saw you, yes, but sweet that's impossible
No sentence can be more beautiful than then

And for that one ten seconds
Never found a better word



Or then that evening at the beach
No idea anymore how I got there
Had to think what year it had been
I had a bit of a party

I wanted to leave, that's how I went crazy
And the sea and I had a great conversation
And suddenly I thought: Everything will pass
You can always leave because you are free to escape
You can always leave, you are free to flee

And for that one ten seconds
Never found a better word
Then la la la <|endoftext|> 
Lullaby

Leave me in the dark
Let me sit in the night
I see your shadow in the dark
Go to sleep, I'll keep watch

Let me sing to you softly
A song that just didn't exist
A song that will change again tomorrow
And so it never gets completed

Let me down
Let me sing
So glad to be there
From your eyes, your smile
Your tears, those things
Which I even recognize here in the dark

Surrender to the dark
Let yourself fall into the night
Forget everything there was, know
Waiting for you tomorrow



Let's play together tomorrow
Let's laugh in the sun
I'll sing you to life
And how that only started with you

Surrender
I'll sing you
From a world without pain
You don't have to know
Those things
Only to be here with me

And to hear of a life where love reigns supreme
And to believe, if only for a moment, that hatred is taught
That people would rather kiss than fight on the news
That the bear will get better, the cat will get up tomorrow
That he also sleeps and that everything will be fine

Hear me sing from a distance
Hear me sing through the night
I ask the stars for protection
I see the moon smiling at you too
I'll be with you in the morning
You look up in my face
And a kiss for your mother
Lying there in the big bed next to you <|endoftext|> 
Woke up in the afternoon
And Elisabeth was not there
Walked through the house with my eyes closed
Because I don't really want to see it
I really wish you were here
But wherever you are
I hope I can come there too, one day
And that you still know me

Oh, sleep tight, Elisabeth
Sleep tight, Elisabeth
Sleep tight

Oh, sleep tight, Elisabeth
Sleep tight, Elisabeth
Sleep tight

Not everyone can be a hero
People also need to be saved
The trick is dancing on the golden mean
And I can only just manage that
Nobody can tell
Why and why you
And I because I'm still here
I drag myself to the front door
And then I look the middle way is already clear

And I say
Oh, sleep tight, Elisabeth
Sleep tight, Elisabeth
Sleep tight



Oh, sleep tight, Elisabeth
Sleep tight, Elisabeth
Sleep tight

Sometimes I see you in the locker room
Just before the first song
Sometimes I suddenly see you among the people
But when I leave her later, it wasn't you
I know you will never come again
But I'm holding on to what it was
Tonight I dream of ourselves as queen again
And king of our second-hand mattress

And I say
Oh, sleep tight, Elisabeth
Sleep tight
Elisabeth, sleep tight

Oh, sleep tight, Elisabeth
Sleep tight
Elisabeth, sleep tight
Elisabeth, sleep tight

Elisabeth, sleep tight
Elisabeth, sleep tight

Woke up in the afternoon
and Elisabeth was not there. <|endoftext|> 
I am strolling through the city
and watch the bus go again
am too late again
but can hit myself

because the way to you
takes such an eternity
every day again
lost all my chances

every time I make that seldom mistake
Think about us
and Spanish get stuffy
have strong doubts about our being together
I'll let you go even if it hurts you

how do I tell you about my insecurity
that I love you
now seems a thing of the past



butterflies in my stomach
they die one by one
am not so in love
like I was before

every time I make that seldom mistake
Think about us
and Spanish get stuffy
have strong doubts about our being together

are you shy or are you struggling?
or are you sometimes in a bad mood
your head is often nagged ooo
then let them know that you are going to forget
that everyone touches you over and over again
you no longer have your own opinion
because the best helmsmen are ashore
against all knowledge
you always give others their own way

never take any notice of someone else
always stay behind yourself
just be how you want to be most
stick to what you believe in
then he won't get you down

know that life can give you much more
as long as you always go your own way
and everywhere you stand ooo
then you will see that you finally know what you
radiates to so many over and over again
and counts your own opinion

A thousand clouds are in the sky
and it's been raining for hours
I woke up and look
in the wet morning gray
but deep inside of me
my heart laughs because i feel it
my thoughts are with you

like you - like you
nobody laughed at me
nobody brought me luck
i feel love for the first time
that starts off well
i feel as grown up as a man

This night of the best dreams
it will soon be true
everything went so well so well
like in the film from hollywood
the star that was you
and there was only the two of us
and the feelings were so free



like you - like you
nobody laughed at me
nobody brought me luck
i feel love for the first time
that starts off well
i feel as grown up as a man

i feel love for the first time
that starts right away
i feel as grown up as a man
I think I'll say now I'm a man <|endoftext|> 
Are you shy? or is it something wrong?
or are you sometimes in a bad mood?
And is your head often nagged?
(who o o o)

Then let them know that you're going to forget what everyone else is recommending you over and over again.
You no longer have your own opinion.
Because the best helmsmen are ashore.
Against your better judgment you always give others their own way.

Never worry about someone else, always stay behind yourself.
Just be what you want to be most.
If you hold on to what you believe in, people will not get you down.

Know that life can give you much more if you always go your own way.
And you stand your ground everywhere.
(who o o o)
Then you will see that you finally know what you are radiating to so many over and over again.
and counts your own opinion.

Because the best helmsmen are on shore, just go against him.
Then you will get your own way from now on.



Never worry about someone else, always stay behind yourself.
Just be what you want to be most.
If you hold on to what you believe in, people will not get you down.

Because the best helmsmen are ashore, just leave them there.

I've been in the sand for a while now
Just woke up on the beach in Tobago
You have long since flown
Was gone before it started
Am alone and look at the horizon
Palms keep waving past me
Sky-high waves make me happy
Someday I'll find you, wouldn't know where you are
Have been used to this loneliness for a long time

Wish I could keep sailing forever
On that beautiful blue sea
About oceans, in your thoughts you are with it
If only I could keep sailing
To an endless existence
Not just happiness around me anymore, a dream that will never end

I would like to stay here until my death
The pearl white beaches and my boat
It never gets boring here
It's still a good idea
And the heat goes with me forever

Wish I could keep sailing forever
On that beautiful blue sea
About oceans, in your thoughts you are with it
If only I could keep sailing
To an endless existence
No more alone but happiness around me a dream that will never end

Wish I could keep sailing forever
On that beautiful blue sea
About oceans, in your thoughts you are with it
If only I could keep sailing
To an endless existence
No more alone but happiness around me a dream that will never end

A furniture cart in front of the house
There's going on in the neighboring house
Chairs bed table and cupboard
A bird and a dog
A girl gets out of the car
She is young and beautiful
Man i have in my life
Never seen anything so beautiful
She is from Amsterdam
She is the swarming one
And now we live foolishly
She laughed at me
She did well
Maybe she'll go out with me someday
One look and it happened
I saw stars in her eyes
And now I'd love to have her
Forever very close

Then I saw her standing in the garden
With flowers in hand
I asked hey are these for me
She laughed and disappeared
About five minutes later
There was a bouquet in front of my door
And a letter in which it was written
That's why you're going out with me



She is from Amsterdam
She is the swarming one
And now we live foolishly
She laughed at me
She did well
Maybe she'll go out with me someday
One look and it happened
I saw stars in her eyes
And now I'd love to have her
Forever very close

A little gel still through the hair
One last smile in the bathroom
Then I'll ask you right away
Whether she feels like going to the cinema

She is from Amsterdam
She is the swarming one
And now we live foolishly
She laughed at me
She did well
Maybe she'll go out with me someday
One look and it happened
I saw stars in her eyes
And now I'd love to have her
Forever very close
And now I'd love to have her
Forever very close <|endoftext|> 
Listen to the wind
In which I find peace and tranquility
Listening to you
What else you wanted to ask me
Come on
I'll let you hear what silence is
Just go,
And be prepared for the calm in the storm


Chorus:
Tonight ... I'm with you
You kiss me and I kiss you
Let's just shut up
About what's to come
Nobody needs to know
What about love


Take a look at the sun
With which the day started again
Looking at you again
What else you would ask me for
Come on
I let you feel what silence is
Just go,
And be liberated to the calm in the storm


Chorus:
Tonight ... I'm with you
You kiss me and I kiss you
Let's just shut up
About what's to come
Nobody needs to know
What about love






Tonight, I'm with you
You kiss me and I kiss you
Let's just shut up
About what's to come
Nobody needs to know
What about love


Tonight, I'm with you
You kiss me and I kiss you. <|endoftext|> 
A feeling of beautiful dreams,
a feeling that does not pass.
That I could meet you
in that crowded street.
Sleepless nights through those eyes of yours
I want to share everything with you you are the ideal woman.

Stack up on you, all the world knows.
I'm so obsessed with you. I'll hold you all my life.
Stack up on you, no I don't have to explain
but i want to say it so bad, you are for me
a princess dream.

I'd rather be dead than alive
if you left me.
I'd give it up completely
there wouldn't be a day without a tear.
Finally the right one, which I totally go for.
I will not just let you go, where you are going I will be.

Stack up on you, all the world knows.
I'm so obsessed with you. I'll hold you all my life.
Stack up on you, no I don't have to explain
but i want to say it so bad, you are for me
a princess dream.



Even with my eyes closed I can see you
I don't want to lose you, I'll never let you go !!

Stack up on you, all the world knows.
I'm so obsessed with you. I'll hold you all my life.

Get up get up
Get up get up
Get up get up
Get up get up

Get up get up come reach your hand to me get up and feel nice and free ..

the sun was shining when I saw you there ..
I was wondering where is that going ..
I secretly followed you all day ..
Until you just disappeared out of nowhere ...
My search for you lasted all week ..
You suddenly didn't seem to exist.
Until I saw you again at the disco ..
You were back smiling at me ...

Get up, get up, get up and dance with me ..
Get up get up cause I want you yes you ...
Get up, get up, reach out your hand to me ...
Get up and feel nice and free.

Get up, get up, get up and dance with me ..
Get up get up cause I want you yes you ...
Get up, get up, reach out your hand to me ...
Get up and feel nice and free.



The next day took far too long.
Never before have I thought of a girl like this ..
But somehow I was a little scared ...
Maybe I lost you now ..
A week seems like a year when I wait for you ..
The clock always seems to stop.
But finally it's Saturday again.
Because with you I sweep the dance floor ..

Get up, get up, get up and dance with me ..
Get up get up cause I want you yes you ...
Get up, get up, reach out your hand to me ...
Get up and feel nice and free.

get up get up get up and dance with me ..
Get up get up cause I want you yes you ...
Get up, get up, reach out your hand to me ...
Get up and feel nice and free.

I want you .. I want to live with you like this ..
Yes I want you .. I would give you everything ..
I want you .. I want to share this life with you ..
Yes I want you .. Because you are not like so many ..

Get up, get up, get up and dance with me ..
Get up get up cause I want you yes you ...
Get up, get up, reach out your hand to me ...
Get up and feel nice and free.

Get up, get up, get up and dance with me ..
Get up get up cause I want you yes you ...
Get up, get up, reach out your hand to me ...
Get up and dance with me.

Hope it isn't tomorrow
The doubt and uncertainty in your eyes
You act as if you are not looking, avoiding the choice
It's already too late for me, my heart has already been touched by you

Hope it is better tomorrow
The distance between you and me will disappear
Pretend you're not looking, avoiding my gaze
It's not too late for us, I want to know if you're going

Put your arms around me
I will never leave you alone
Let me feel your love deep inside
Put your arms around me
Just hold me tight
I would give up everything for a life with you alone



Hope it will remain different tomorrow
That you have chosen me forever
And the world is wide open to us two
It is really not too late now, we know it is

Put your arms around me
I will never leave you alone
Let me feel your love deep inside
Put your arms around me
Just hold me tight
I would give up anything for a life with you

I can no longer be alone
You can rely on me, trust me blindly

Put your arms around me
I will never leave you alone
Let me feel your love deep inside
Put your arms around me
Just hold me tight
I would give up everything for a life with you alone <|endoftext|> 
You speak the language of love
je t'aime, tu est mon amour
sounds in the cafe, there in old Paris
a song by Charles Aznavour

walk the streets with you
over the champs de lysee
when we are under the Eiffel Tower
you sing very softly with me

imagine me in paradise
in that beautiful city of Paris
diamond on the Seine
where you said your t'aime

violin music everywhere
in the heart of romance
am totally flustered
through that beautiful city of Paris



I write in a beautiful chanson
how our romance began
on a terrace, the wine was cool
the summer evening so sultry

and I sang to you ...
je chante pour toi, chere madame
un jour, tu sera, ma femme

imagine me in paradise
in that beautiful city of Paris
diamond on the Seine
where you said your t'aime

I say too little to you how beautiful you are
How well life fares with you standing next to me
I say too little to you how happy I am
When you reach out to me just looking at me
But I miss you, I miss you, here and there and everywhere you are not with me.

Straight from my heart I sing to you, straight from my heart because I love
Of how you make me fall in love again every day,
Straight from my heart as long as I live, straight from my heart because I give
Because of you and who you are to me, I miss you every moment.

I say too little to you how sweet you are
How all the heat around me comes from you alone
I say too little to you how proud I am
Though I'm far from you, my heart will beat for you
Because I miss you, I miss you, here and there and everywhere you are not with me.



Straight from my heart I sing to you, straight from my heart because I love
Of how you make me fall in love again every day,
Straight from my heart as long as I live, straight from my heart because I give
Because of you and who you are to me, I miss you every moment.

You are what I need, you keep me going
Without you and all your love I'll never go anywhere again.

Straight from my heart I sing to you, straight from my heart because I love
Of how you make me fall in love again every day,
Straight from my heart as long as I live, straight from my heart because I give
Because of you and who you are to me, I miss you every moment.

For you and who you are for me
I live every moment. <|endoftext|> 
My daddy gave me his last kiss
before going to sea.
He smiled softly: "I love you"
but I also saw a tear.
And when I get home little boy
I bring something for you
a canary beetle in yellow and blue.
it only sings for you.

But daddy, where are you now?
Sometimes I cry for you at night
then I'm afraid that you will perish
and I don't know what to do.
Daddy, where are you now?
There on that great sea.
Oh, come home,
and bring my bird.



The years have passed
I didn't see my dad again.
But I kept staring at the sea
always took my cage with me.
Until one day I saw that bird
a bird yellow and blue.
A canary cap, I was so happy.
He only sang for me.

But daddy, where are you now?
Sometimes I cry for you at night
then I'm afraid that you will perish
and I don't know what to do.
Daddy, where are you now?
There on that great sea.
Oh, come home,
and bring my bird.

Jan Smit on the way to happiness

I would like to tell you what I feel
You are so nice and so cool
I've had an idea for a long time
You just walk along

I don't know what to do next
I hope for your first kiss someday
I'm afraid to go to you
Can you see me?

(Chorus)
I always see you walking by your side that one man
Can only hope if you can
Far from here and yet close
I'm on my way to some happiness
Dreams come true
Or do they float by forever

When you look, I avoid your face
I see you better with my eyes closed
In our minds we are two
Do you think along



I am trapped in uncertainty
I have nowhere to express those feelings
You are so far removed from me here
Come closer

(Chorus)
I always see you walking by your side that one man
can only hope that you can
Far from here and yet close
I'm on my way to some happiness
Dreams come true
Or do they float by forever

Dreams come true
Or do they float to me forever

One more time my heart
To love oneself is to suffer, to suffer is to go
It has always been like that until today
One more time my heart
To love oneself is to suffer, to suffer is to go
It has always been like that until today
Hated you made decisions, let it all happen
Always emptiness in the head and in the room
But you, you just happened
I find myself thinking of you
But you touched me once and I knew very clearly
I give away
one more time my heart, one more time my heart
I can never go back anyway
the best chance is always at this moment
one more time my heart, one more time my heart
I never wanted to be defeatable again
but now I get up and use it
One more time my heart!



To love you is to float
Belong to heaven, to float on strong winds sails
and it fits in my life to crave you
my soul follows completely new rules.
Like you, I'm finally with myself
wasn't everything much weaker so far?
Like you, like me, like us
and I give it to you more and more
one more time my heart, one more time my heart
I can never go back anyway
the best chance is always at this moment
one more time my heart, one more time my heart
I never wanted to be defeatable again,
but now I get up and use it. One more time my heart!

It just wants the first choice
That's why I'll give it again
One more time my heart, one more time my heart
I can never go back anyway
the best chance is always at this moment
one more time my heart, one more time my heart
I never wanted to be defeatable again
but now I get up and use it
One more time my heart <|endoftext|> 
Suddenly the day has come
For the first time here in my own home
I took all my things with me
And yet I don't feel at home yet

A new step in my life
No, that is not without a struggle
And my mom just called me
I always keep up with her

-Chorus-

It takes some getting used to being alone
On their own
My sandwiches are burned every morning
And the dirty dishes did not disappear by themselves
But luckily my own newspaper every day

It's not that I want to go back to the old days
Even though I often think about it
I admire my mom and dad
What they have done for me



-Chorus-

it takes some getting used to being alone
on their own
every morning my sandwiches are burnt
and the dirty dishes did not disappear by themselves
but luckily my own newspaper every day

I feel like a fish in water (water)
am free as a bird
sometimes it goes against the grain and sometimes it goes well
but that's all part of it

-Chorus-

it takes some getting used to being alone
on their own
every morning my sandwiches are burnt
and the dirty dishes did not disappear by themselves
but luckily my own newspaper every day! <|endoftext|> 
Every person has his own work,
From carpenter to priest in the church.
But that doesn't apply to me, because wherever you see me,
I sing the highest song everywhere.

Because at the stage, I indulge myself.
Throughout the country, from north-east-west to south.
I've been to almost every city,
but every night is a party again.

Very often I perform around midnight,
when my warm bed is normally waiting for me.
But only then do I come loose, throw my hair to the wind,
when the whole hall sings with me.



Because at the stage, I indulge myself.
Throughout the country, from north-east-west to south.
I've been to almost every city,
but every night is a party again.

All those people with radiant eyes, their evening really can't go wrong.
Everyone happy and so delighted, what could be better than so much happiness.

Because at the stage, I indulge myself.
Throughout the country, from north-east-west to south.
I've been to almost every city,
but every night is a party again.
(2x)
I've been to almost every city,
but every night is a party again .. <|endoftext|> 
On the way to happiness

I would like to tell you what I feel
you are so nice and so cool
have been running with an idea for a long time
you just walk along
I don't know what to do next
I hope for your first kiss someday
I am afraid to go to you
you can see me

I always see you walking
by your side that one man
can only hope
or it can be with you

far from here and yet close
am on the way to some happiness
dreams become reality
or they float by forever

if you look then I avoid your face
See you better with my eyes closed
in mind there are two of us
you think along
I am trapped in uncertainty
I have nowhere to express those feelings
you are so far removed from me here
come closer

I always see you walking
by your side that one man
can only hope
or it can be with you



far from here and yet close
am on the way to some happiness
dreams become reality
or they float by forever

dreams become reality
or do they drift past me forever <|endoftext|> 
I'm driving home
just got away from you
a tear slowly runs down my cheeks
my heart is broken
the world too small
just wants to be close to you

who can stop us
we don't harm anyone
who will stop the rain
that you leave behind
glassy eyes
I can hardly anymore
but don't accept it

I'm tonight
drowned in my tears
no one saw that
I have never been
sunk so low
because what I dream is not allowed



Because what I dream is not allowed.


- I experience that too,
- With my parents.
- I love someone I'm not allowed to hang out with,
- I wish someone could persuade my parents. <|endoftext|> 
Looking for some traces
From a hopeless man
Just walked away
Without any purpose or plan
What was the reason
Of his lonely existence
Why was he avoided
He suddenly left here

That was the man who never returned from his long journey alone
Left with the northern sun
Never tells why, where to
That was the man who never returned from his long journey alone
Left with the northern sun
Never tells why, where to

A bed to sleep in
That was all he had
Never a friend to talk to
Not a single cent he owned
Looking for an answer as to why he did this
Nobody will know
He left in silence

That was the man who never returned from his long journey alone
Left with the northern sun
Never tells why, where to
That was the man who never returned from his long journey alone
Left with the northern sun
Never tells why, where to



Roaming the streets
Nobody looked at him
Nothing to live for
It was the fate of his existence

That was the man who never returned from his long journey alone
Left with the northern sun
Never tells why, where to
That was the man who never returned from his long journey alone
Left with the northern sun
Never tells why, where to

That was the man that never came back, that was the man that never came back, that was the man that never came back. <|endoftext|> 
Look at me
Before you go
I always thought of a miracle
But now that I know
My heart forgets you
To every day thunder

I return to my freedom
Never again that tender kiss
To a long time
I just don't know what to do

It has not been about roses for so long
You haven't seen me in months
Now you have chosen this path
Why did you do this to me
How am I supposed to continue in this life
When you are no longer by my side
I can't believe what you're doing
Leave me

That one day
That I saw you
You lay by the water making love
I asked why
You didn't even look back
And I only realized later
I return to freedom
You don't have an eye for me anymore
So after that time
Am I alone and free again

It has not been about roses for so long
You haven't seen me in months
Now you have chosen this path
Why did you do this to me
How am I supposed to continue in this life
When you are no longer by my side
I can't believe what you're doing
Leave me



How am I supposed to continue in this life
When you are no longer by my side
I can't believe what you're doing
Leave me <|endoftext|> 
mama mama mama bring you flowers
Don't cry mama, because if you get well you'll come home to me again.

oh mama mia k love you

Don't cry mama because after a rain shower there is always sunshine.

Just close your eyes for a moment,
Feel the love around you
You make our best dreams come true
Since the day you appeared

Every day I hold you in my arms
A feeling I've never known before
No one as beautiful as you
No one as proud as us
You're an angel so small
I always want to be with you

Now that you were born
Everyone knows your name
I'll spend the rest of my life
Giving everything for you.

Just close your eyes for a moment,
Feel the love around you
You make our dreams come true
Since the day you appeared

Every day I hold you in my arms
A feeling I've never known before


Every day I hold you in my arms
A feeling I've never known before



No one as proud as us
You're an angel so small
I want to be with you. <|endoftext|> 
Every new spring
everything is new to me,
because winter is dead,
New Year's Eve is over.

I feel the new light
I change my mind.
I'm following a new love
I change face.

And I forget
I forget what has been.
I forget,
I forget what has been.
Because what has been has been.

But on the night of the New Year's Eve
the scythe of criticism awaits.
And I'm ashamed of myself
i destroy my music.
I was on the wrong track again
I've ventured too much again.
I haven't given anything again
and way too much to ask.

And I forget ...



The time will come
that I don't have to anymore
because spring is dead,
the new year is over.
I feel the same light
but it won't change anything anymore.
I follow my old love
and I think about her face.

And I'll take
I take what has been.
I take with me,
I take what has been.
But what has been has been.

Then I'll sit by the fire
and sometimes I feel alone.
Then I sing my old song
for the children around me.
They listen quietly and play on
and look at me insecure.
But I'll sing to them
until we go to sleep.

And I forget ...

And I forget ... <|endoftext|> 
I would like to know you before you go
Whether you can just forget about me
Without telling me where you are going
Oh you, before you go you have to say it
Or there is nothing more to explain
About the reason you're going

Do you like it better, I get that pain as a gift
If you never see me again, won't it hurt you
I wouldn't know where to start without you

Chorus:
No one else can do what you can with me
No one else knows what I am like
No one else does what you do to me, no
No one but you for me



You, before you go, a few more questions
To have to bear this grief
I'm looking for answers that you want to give me
Oh you, before you go I want to hear it
Or is all hope really lost?
And are you sure you are going

Do you like it better, I get that pain as a gift
If you never see me again, won't it hurt you
I wouldn't know where to start without you

Chorus: 3x

No one else can do what you can with me
No one else knows what I am like
No one else does what you do to me, no
No one but you for me <|endoftext|> 
To die on the water with your paper wings
Just float, after flying in the clouds you float here
With your colors fading
Without searching without questions
Finally rest forever
And the flowers you kissed
Scents you have known
You can forget everything now
You rock back and forth on the water
To die on the water with your paper wings



like a butterfly that can fly into the blue sky
like a butterfly always free and on the run from life
I want to die on the water
but that's a concern later on
I want to fly like a butterfly now
on the flowers, blisters fly
but I can't get that high
so I just fly in my dreams
I am always on the run from life
like a butterfly that can fly into the blue sky

To live I thought you should be a butterfly
To fly very far away from all life, all pain
But I no longer suffer from jealousy of a butterfly
If even butterflies are to die, I will not let my joy be spoiled
I can live without flies
What more could I give
About a butterfly that drowned in May
I really don't have to be a butterfly to live <|endoftext|> 
So you're more than fed up with this life
so you want some more of this and that,
so you actually want a little bit of everything.
That's how I know you again.
The days go by so empty
no one takes a step aside anymore.
There is not an ounce of fun anymore
and you don't want that anymore.

Well wet your chest
you have nothing and I have plenty.
Here you have some happy violins.
Well, then get ready
because this will be the big blow.
Here you have a bite of cheerful violins.

They're constantly chasing you
and Leiden is still in trouble.
You are stuck on all sides
and give up.
You are completely nuts
faked, taken, mowed down,
caught, bred and sewn on.
And you can not do that anymore.



Well, wet your chest ...

The nights are so cold and long
faces grin on the wallpaper
and everything tastes too sour for you.
And you don't want that anymore.
You don't want to be in sack and ashes anymore
with everyone in the goose step,
no, you want to stretch out in the grass.
And so I know you again.

Well, wet your chest ... <|endoftext|> 
After 22 years in this life,
I make a will of my youth.
Not that I have money or goods to give away
I have never felt good for a smart boy.
But I still have some nice ideals,
well cut although they are out of fashion.
Whoever wants them can come and get them,
especially young people still like them.

To my little brother who so badly wants to study,
I'm happy to leave the address of my pub.
Where I drank too much to impress a woman
and then got hit with what I asked for.

And then I have a few more friends
who are well-educated and very wise,
and with which you cannot start a thunder,
but maybe someone else will get them down.

For my nephew, my unfulfilled wishes are
a bit childish but they are so deep.
I always belonged to that kind of people
for whom luck always ran faster.

I like to leave it to my friends
to fall in love with a girl's smile.
Unfortunately, I was cheated too much once
but if you want to give it a try, you can.

My girlfriend, I leave you all nights
that I have shed tears for your infidelity.
But remember, I will wait patiently
until I laugh because you are being cheated too.



And the teacher who always threatened me:
"Boy, you are still on the wrong path!"
Can be satisfied and don't have to get anything more
that is to say he was right after all.

(instrumental)

For my parents is the album with the pictures,
which so falsely testify to a joyful youth.
But they don't show the bland talk
who raise a child in honor and virtue.

And they get all silly things back
that they taught me too much that time.
After all, they can't force me either
to grow big without deep regret and regret.

And then I also have some good friends
but they've had enough of me already.
So I now give them the wages they deserve
All the booze they stole from me.

Nothing else, just a few more things
which I love because it does not benefit anyone.
Those are my good childhood memories
you take it with you as long as you live. <|endoftext|> 
Times are different
or is it different in my head?
Maybe never looked closely
perhaps too lightly believed.
And it always has been
maybe this is how it goes.
It's getting dark faster and faster,
and it's getting earlier and earlier.

It will take some getting used to
but even getting used to that.
Everything changes again
when you are gone.
Too bad you have to leave now
just when things are going well.
It's getting dark faster and faster,
and it's getting earlier and earlier.

As much as you would like,
you don't do anything about it anymore.
The things that happen
go as they go.
But those few moments are great
what it's all about.
It's getting dark faster and faster,
and it's getting earlier and earlier.



Don't believe in heaven
don't believe in hell.
You are born and you die,
and it was.
There is only life
the life you make.
It's getting dark faster and faster,
and it's getting earlier and earlier.

It's getting dark faster and faster,
and it's getting earlier and earlier.

Getting late all the time.
Darker and faster.

Getting late all the time.
It is getting dark faster and faster. <|endoftext|> 
It's finally a fact
i know i'm grown up
I have to watch out now
with work and money and time.
The years have passed
of lounging and learning,
innocently mock,
be drunk and happy.

I have a wife, a child
a purpose to live for,
but yesterday I thought for a moment:
where is my best friend?
Who I was with at the time
attacked life
and taught French themes
and with the same regret
knew the girl
that stole our hearts
and then became engaged
with a third-year student.

That boy from my class
who was older in years
and therefore more experienced,
who owned that booklet
that later one day
was found by father,
which contained those pictures
where you saw everything.



The friend who has all the fun
and shared concerns with me,
the toughness we played,
the first cigarette.
The first chaste kiss
got it from a girl
in exchange for the chocolate ice cream,
what she wanted to do it for.
The friends of that time,
where have they gone now?
And sometimes I think for a moment:
did I lose myself sometimes?

The innocence of a child
only to see what is true,
what friendship is for each other
while you find later
that everything is different
than before in your dreams,
nothing came of it,
so you were mistaken.

I too sooner or later
sang that song
of dear good boy,
but with a heart full of hatred.
Where have my friends gone
that I trusted effortlessly,
on whom I built dreams?
Unfortunately I am alone now.
Because now I know
you can't rely on anyone
you can't trust anybody
so I just dream
so I just dream
and forget. <|endoftext|> 
There was a time before I knew you
that I am empty but full of misery
swearing at the whole gang
was waiting in a pub
to the girl of my dreams
would pass one day.
And I let my tears flow
if I had another hangover.
And that my dear friends
with which I served the muses
and did not earn a single cent
even though I said no
arrived in the evening
to start a chat
and then in the morning jet drunk
were put on the sidewalk.

There was a time when I got the most
had to tell at parties
where I am with enlightened spirits
often discussed politics.
Where we were never mistaken,
people who knew better,
were all fascists
who lacked understanding.

When I stared at my belly button
and declared me a communist
and with all other beards
was waiting for the bomb.
As long as it wouldn't fall
people soon heard lags
and we all lay together
world-peaceful on the mat.



At the time, I could be the women
view with an expert eye
and I never wanted to get married
because that didn't serve me.
I just wanted to live together
with a black-robed beauty
to show the bourgeoisie
how open-minded I was.

But it was unavoidable
that I was lonely at times
so that I desperately made love
with a ballet girl.
Which beauty quickly withered
in the morning when you wake up
with the butts on the plates
and the crumbs in the bed.

One day I ran into you
sweet and small and so shy,
dripping in the spring rain
in the big strange city.
You knew nothing about provoking
and you wanted to convert me
and I let myself learn everything
if only I had your love.

Now I am reading the newspaper
and be a civilian.
I don't have to fear hunger anymore
yet sometimes I think with regret
from the time before I knew you
to the merry misery,
to the artistic gang
of the good old days <|endoftext|> 
Who tells me about life?
Big brother, he knows best.
When I grow up, I just want to
big and strong like the rest.
The cat doesn't think so.
He says: I can understand him now.
When I grow up, that's gone
because grown-ups don't talk to cats.

And now I am grown
and important and student.
Big brother you're dead now
I never knew you as a friend.
You're a heavy man
you are a great stranger father.
A gentleman who can know.
But to me you are only a traitor.

Butterflies sang in the trees,
birds sat on my hand.
Little man, you're dreaming
come use your mind now.
And I have now.
At first, mind was a whole new game,
I could no longer understand the cat,
the school turned hell after a week.
Paradise is not for big boys.



So far very normal,
everyone grows up once,
it happens to all of us
and everyone dies his infant death.
You're gonna be a big guy
you become a slow tall boy
who knows Tacitus and Wolkers
and has neatly repressed all his dreams.

Butterflies must become caterpillars,
birds crawl into their eggs.
Flying is not an option
of human society.
Yet sometimes there is a way.

Yet there is something that survives
and sometimes you can get away for a while
because whoever wants to has wings,
if only to dream,
just to dream. <|endoftext|> 
When do you expose yourself, do you show yourself
Are you afraid of others or maybe yourself
I try to follow you closely, yet you remain vague to me
And for every answer you give, there is another riddle

And you keep hiding yourself behind the smile on your face
You keep hiding yourself behind the smile on your face
And never more than one tip of the veil is lifted

Even though I urge you, I'm on your skin
I never get closer to you, you keep fleeing from me
Will I ever find out what's inside you
Or do you want to be a mystery I never find out

And you keep hiding yourself behind the smile on your face
You keep hiding yourself behind the smile on your face
And never more than one tip of the veil is lifted

Behind every door I open
you close another door
and so you stay hidden,
there is never more than one tip
lifted from the veil



Behind every door I open
you close another door
and so you stay hidden,
there is never more than one tip
lifted from the veil

Behind every door I open
you close another door
and so you stay hidden,
there is never more than one tip
lifted from the veil

Behind every door I open
you close another door
and so you stay hidden,
there is never more than one tip
lifted from the veil

Behind every door I open
you close another door
and so you stay hidden,
there is never more than one tip
lifted from the veil

Behind every door I open
you close another door <|endoftext|> 
You had a wife, a house,
you had your own life.
But it turned out to be a dead end,
you went back again.
You walk through town again
where everything started,
trying to forget
not to stand still.

The friends in the cafe,
they haven't changed much.
One is a bit thicker
and the other is married.
You just don't smile anymore
for all their silly jokes.
They remained old boys
you just got old.

You feel like a snail
on whom life puts salt,
the burden of the past
weighs very heavy on your back.
A mother of pearl shell
full of childhood memories,
and don't you dare any further,
then you crawl back into it.



You wanted to move forward anyway
you wanted to go to freedom
but it became a bare room
rented out for way too much.
You brought a girl
it seemed just like before,
but actually you wanted to sleep.

Finally stop
to moan about the past.
The one who always looks back,
it falls on his face.
You are only afraid
for what is yet to come.
That can't be so much
now shut your mouth.

Still you want to do it again
but where do you start?
You hesitated too many times
too often wrongly decided.
You're lost alone
the forest is big and dark,
the bread crumbs disappeared. <|endoftext|> 
Now you lie next to me and you sleep, I hear you breathe
And in the early morning light, I see your room for the first time
You're so warm you're soft, your arm is on my shoulder
You've been so nice last night, I've loved you
Oh I wish I could tell you, "I'll be with you forever"
That I could free myself from that crazy urge for freedom

I know I will long for your room for years to come
To the records you played, tears on your cheeks
How you listened to me and whispered "I get you"
How we lay together, laughed together at a joke
Oh, I wish I could share one more night like this with you
Your arms around me, your soft hands caressing me



I keep thinking about your eyes when saying goodbye
Every time I want to be with you
Over and over I think, I am leaving and now forever
And I know it hurts you.

Now you lie next to me and you sleep, I hear you breathe
And in the early morning light, I see your room again
You're so warm you're soft, your arm is on my shoulder
You've been so nice last night, I've loved you
Oh, I wish I could share one more night like this with you
Your arms around me, your soft hands caressing me <|endoftext|> 
In old cathedrals
built of gothic glass
lie dead cardinals
to love their friends
in stone and bronze and gold.
And wise owls are descending
down there as gray as lead
with the echo of stories
which the princes tell them
centuries after their death.

Should I stay or move on?
I put on my multi-colored jacket with bells,
the shell hat, the staff in hand,
that's how I walk in Tegenland.

Growing in morning mists
from crater lakes cold
sugar lilies that are about to bloom
rising under organ tones,
a chimes of gold.
The wind is blowing from the south
so you can hear it
and the distant cavern sounds
lingers in the snow-white light,
that smells like gingerbread.



Should I stay or move on? ...

Far above all the valleys
and misty mountains high,
higher than the sun's rays
I will rise with my dreams
along the glass rainbow.
I will manage anyway
at the end of the trip
to pick the yellow moon?
Would it taste like bananas
or vanilla ice cream?

We wish all listeners a Happy New Year.

Should I stay or move on? ... <|endoftext|> 
I was a little boy Sunday morning was hell
And pastors told me what I was not allowed and what was allowed.
Well God always saw everything big and strict as a cop,
So I obediently put my sticky penny in the church bag.

Well on Sunday afternoon my mother went to visit my aunt and then I had to come along,
I got biscuits and wet kisses and a squeeze in my cheek and a cup of weak tea.

Yes, aunt Julia, I already seem much older,
I'll play the piano if you want
But take your breasts off my shoulder

I was a little boy
If it was my birthday then was allowed
I'm going to blow out the candles
On the cake that mother bought
And my grandmother sobbed for a moment, well another year has passed
But no one ever heard what she said softly to me

And suddenly aunt jumped up and clapped both hands and called me her guy.
And she said play for your aunt and the rest
because it's your birthday.



Yes, aunt Julia, I already seem much older,
I'll play the piano if you want
But take your breasts off my shoulder

And now I am a little older and now I live everywhere
And in the morning I often don't know where I will sleep in the evening
I travel all over the world
Chasing the sunlight
I've left everyone except Aunt Julia

It's Sunday morning and I have nothing to do and I feel like going to my aunt
If she wants to give me a kiss, I have to bend over and she herself has to stand on tiptoe

Yes, aunt Julia, I already seem much older,
I'll play the piano if you want
But take your breasts off my shoulder

Where can you lie in the sand until your whole body burns
Where can you drink like an animal, where can you find friends for every party
Where can you swim like a rat, where do you even get wet inside
That is on the outskirts of the Netherlands
That is on our unsurpassed beach
There you can have sex with your wife, which should not be anywhere else
While you calmly read your newspaper, caress your hands around her
There you play poker with a friend until he cries of misery
That's where the Randstad stands out, that's on our unsurpassed beach
You go there on the moped and then lie flat until a quarter to one
Then you look at a woman you would like to pick up
Then you get into an argument with her husband, who just happens to be able to box
And with your teeth in your hand you trudge on the beach again
Then you go to a tent and if you are tipsy
Then you walk along the boulevard with a crowd of friends
Then someone comes up with the idea to go for a swim in the sea
And overcome by jellyfish you run back across the beach
But at four o'clock in the afternoon, the height of fun comes
Then a friend who drives a car comes to have a look for fun
Then you go along with him a few rows along the sea
He drives 100 with one hand and waves to the beach with the other
Then you tear down the street singing and find that everything is going beautifully
You simply bend your neck, you look around at all the girls
And father's car is murdered, expertly drilled into a tree
Then you will be in the newspaper tomorrow and become famous all over the beach
And in the evening on the quiet beach something is wrong again
Then there will be a great party like there has never been
Then the beach fire is stoked on which delicious sausages are cooked
And with transistors in hand, the whole troop returns to the beach
One comes with bottles of wine, which tastes suspiciously like vinegar
The second comes with his girlfriend, who then picks up the third
The fourth brings a bag of fries with a thunderous hole at the bottom
the contents are scattered in the sand of three quarters of a kilometer of beach
You dance and make love all the time while you bite into a sandwich
And pour gin into your cup, otherwise your dad would drink it
But that load of alcohol will quickly overload you
Then the situation gets out of hand and you stay on the beach
but the police arrive before you learn to walk again
So that you crawl away behind a column of gin
That then becomes an immense riot that usually ends in the cell
And once you have arrived there, it is quiet again on the beach
But in the morning you lie back in the sand until your whole body burns
Then you drink like an animal, then you find friends for a party
Then you go swimming like a rat, you even get wet inside
On the outskirts of the Netherlands, on our unsurpassed beach (3x) <|endoftext|> 
Sex education,
that is a very important thing.
Who thought that everything went just like that
is a conservative.
The stork is done,
where do the children come from now?
What should we do with the situation?
That can't go on like this, can it?

There's a pastor in the TV,
which points out the dangers.
He nods yes and shakes no
but cannot explain them.
Because in the past he was allowed to say:
the whole thing is a sin.
Today that is no longer possible,
you can't say that anymore.
But how should a pastor, dear Lord,
explain the matter now?



The following evening the pastor comes
who will talk to us.
He thinks it can go on with it,
but keep an eye on it.
Because it's hard for him too
because it used to be detestable.
But now there must be water in the wine,
now he has to light up.
But for a pastor it will be difficult,
to illuminate such a case.

The humanist has the next turn,
he even says dirty words,
so that all of Holland colors softly,
for this is worse than murders.
But there's something more honest about him
he says there is nothing more delightful.
We just come right out for it
that should not be called so strange.
And even the youngest must sprout
already know every detail.

Sex education
that's a very important thing ... <|endoftext|> 
You're so sweet, so sensual
so inimitable spiritual.
You talk and laugh and everyone
is full of admiration around you.
The men watch and they do
the greatest effort for a kiss.
You're loved, you're really in
but nobody gets their way with you.
Because you don't feel like such fun
you just want to go to bed early.
You still sleep with a teddy bear
instead of with a handsome gentleman.
With open windows in the cold
like a sporty big woman.

You never go out, never go to a tent
because you are always in training
for some rowing race.
You really don't have time for parties.
Just the party from your club,
a party with only Seven Up,
where the trainer peeks everywhere
and sends you home at ten o'clock.
Then your dad invariably takes you away
and when I say goodnight
then the guy glares at me
and says to you: come on, let's go.
Oh dear Lord, you have that now
with such a damned sporty woman.



What am I hearing: you are in love?
Oh so ... well, please.
On who? Well, yes, yes, I can see it.
Who's that guy? I don't know him?
Oh that's that, yeah, that's nice.
Such a thing should be forbidden.
Now she goes with such a pale bitch
such a piece of bourgeois looks screwed
with that yellow flowerpot hair.
Those two are now a pair
and both train vigorously
for that damn rowdy.
Oh dear Lord, you have that now
with such a damned sporty woman.

Prince Amor, exalted high,
what am I going to do with that girl?
It's ruining my whole life
forever.
I don't have a second rest
that's it.
Chances of her kissing me, Lord
has now been canceled.
Oh dear Lord, you have that now
with such a damned sporty woman. <|endoftext|> 
The flower meadow is decorated green,
we have scattered flowers,
the gold-lured child and us.
Friends, friends, everyone,
seated around the fruit bowl.
You too are welcome, smile and join us.

We give picnic
under willows, under lindens,
between poppies and the blind,
tender loved ones in my heart
and close your eyes, pick a flower.

There are Tony Vos and Lennaert Nijgh
from whom I still get a tenner.
The golden-lured spring child is sleeping soundly.
And sweet smoke from blue lace
surrounds my head like a hair tie
and drops of honey smells on my fur.

We give picnic
with Aunt Bet and Father Jansen
who all dance together,
lily wreaths in their hair.
Come make music, pick a flower.



We ask you,
we take care of the rest.
Lennaert Nijgh and I,
we give picnic.

Now the tin wind band is playing
which has more than a hundred songs.
The golden-lured spring child plays the flute.
Dressed in foam fig leaf
Dylan flies through the sky,
plays hymns on his harp and golden lute.

We give picnic,
for the elves and the fairies,
for the cattle and roe deer,
for the livestock and everyone
must be nice, pick a flower. <|endoftext|> 
Now night is falling
soft as snow
and everything stops in the cold.
Falls from afar
a star in my path,
then I'll take it for you.

Standing still in the forest
dark and old,
the firs petrified on guard.
The light comes from afar,
from light years her
and I'm on my way.



Now is the night
soft as snow,
the sky as blue as ice.
I wear a star
from far in my hand,
I'm on my way to you.

Now night is falling
soft as snow
and everything stops in the cold.
I wear a star
from far in my hand,
I'm on my way to you. <|endoftext|> 
He is standing in the snow at the gate of the city
and puts the days of December on his hat.
He whistles his plush calico cat
because he has problems with mice
who make nests in his beard.
But that always makes him whistle beautifully,
the animal preaches earnestly to the fish
fallen from a herring cart.

He lures the days with his song,
the days fly, it stops.
Where does he come from?
He cherishes the days of red cellophane,
glitter and cotton wool and star paper.
No one knows his name.

Master Sticky Legs, Master Sticky Legs,
people walk past him,
he remains alone, Master Prikkebeen.

Lantern plugs go silently through the night,
he plays his hurdy-gurdy in front of their hairy faces.
Sleep well, sleep soundly.
A paladin with his soldiers
listen to him for a while.
Yet his dish remains empty, they laugh.
Only a girl stops talking
a skinny girl with pleasure.



Why don't you play another song?
Your eyes and your mouth are cold.
I don't know a chorus.
I carry a key of gold on my breasts,
the light in my eye is a star that fades.
I can't be like that.

Master Sticky Legs, Master Sticky Legs,
people walk past him,
he remains alone, Master Prikkebeen.

She is dancing in the snow and playing the tambourine
while the calico cat very quietly preaches passion.
It smells of bread and hot wine
and in the snowy night at the balls
they expect the new year.
The last day comes flying,
the last blows have fallen.
A rocket shoots into the sky.

And tomorrow they disappear across the country.
Tomorrow they will disappear across the country.
The new year is wide and cool,
the flower meadow is empty and green.
They never see him again.
Who knows what the days will do this year.
She is playing with the cat and he waves his hand.
Goodbye and goodbye. Goodbye and goodbye.
Maybe goodbye. Maybe goodbye.

Master Sticky Legs, Master Sticky Legs,
people walk past him,
he remains alone, Master Prikkebeen. <|endoftext|> 
I have two more pairs of shoes in Madrid
some of which suit me fine.
And sometimes I think: I'm taking the train
to be in Madrid again.

There's a bag of laundry in Paris,
in which a shirt, I don't miss that for a price.
And sometimes I think: I will leave
and get that bag of laundry.

I also have a suitcase in Berlin,
but I don't know what the content can be anymore.
And sometimes I think you know what I'm doing
I'll go over to that suitcase.

But yes, Madrid, Paris, Berlin,
where my shoes and my shirt and my suitcase are,
what am I supposed to do with those big cities?
What am I to do with those remains of a distant past.
Those shoes are moldy and that shirt is too small,
and that suitcase probably cannot be lifted.



Ah yes, Paris, Berlin, Madrid,
where someone else has their feet in my shoes.
They will make a duster from that shirt
and that suitcase, after all, it doesn't matter.
What am I supposed to do with those things?
I will stay where I am.
I am with you, tabé Paris, Berlin, Madrid.

I have two more pairs of shoes in Madrid ...

There's a bag of laundry in Paris ...

I also have a suitcase in Berlin ... <|endoftext|> 
It's a town, it's a village,
it is a place or a hamlet.
And you shouldn't be too crazy
otherwise you're so infamous.
Where you say goodbye to the milkman,
grocer and uncle cop,
who will never give you a receipt
because he knows your father.

Where you can whine slowly
to everyone on the street,
because everyone has something
what he's whining about.

Only then do you like it
and you know the whole city.
And then you take your final exam
and then you've had it.
Everyone is somewhere else
and you're fucking alone
with only old people
and family around you.

And then you also want to travel
to Paris or something.
And you will find your whole life
and your country but nothing.



Then you discover new countries
and you go on an adventure.
You are starving in a haystack
and enjoy love pure.
And you come after a few months
home like a vagabond
with a beard and pennies,
you are hungry, thirsty and louse.

And you shave and then you get married
and stays where you are
in your own small town
where you know all the people.

And then they say with satisfaction:
he loses his wild hair.
He's finally growing up
and after another second year
he is just such a big bastard
as his father has been,
who have an opinion on everything
in the morning newspaper.

With its own television
and his own bubble tent,
in its own small town
where he knows all the people.

Not that he will harm a fly
and he is not interesting
and he looks no further
then his drink and his newspaper.
But keep an eye on him
because he is such a small man
who if only asked,
often the best shooting. <|endoftext|> 
There sailed on the North Sea,
the North Sea wide and cold,
a ship so heavily laden
with the world's vain gold.
There the Spaniard came threatening
to steal us the gold,
when we sailed on the North Sea,
the North Sea, the North Sea,
wide and cold already on the North Sea.

It was our youngest buddy,
a boy strong and bold,
he already spoke to the skipper:
what will you do to me,
when I want to go swimming
and over there the Spanish galleon
sink in the North Sea,
the North Sea, the North Sea,
already sink in the North Sea?

I will give you silver,
a weapon and blazon.
My own young daughter
shall I marry you,
when you want to go swimming
and over there the Spanish galleon
sink in the North Sea,
the North Sea, the North Sea,
already sink in the North Sea.



The boy prayed to heaven,
then jumped overboard
and has in the enemy's ship wall
three holes then drilled.
And from the proud Spaniard
has never been heard again,
across the wide North Sea,
the North Sea, the North Sea,
heard more all over the North Sea.

Then he swam to the ship
and the men shouted aloud.
But our skipper gave it to him
not his daughter as a bride.
Although the boy also begged:
get me out of the water
the skipper gave the North Sea,
the North Sea, the North Sea,
gave him the North Sea as his bride.

Then he swam around the ship,
he was so cold and tired.
Full of bitterness and despair
he cried to his fellows:
oh buddies, pick me up,
because I am tired of swimming.
The cold North Sea draws me,
the North Sea, the North Sea,
the North Sea is pulling me towards it.

His fellows then saved him
but on deck he died.
After one two three for God's sake
drifted away with the tide
the brave young naval hero,
much younger than us.
And then sank in the North Sea,
the North Sea, the North Sea,
and he sank in the North Sea. <|endoftext|> 
Going nowhere


All avenues in the vicinity of then went neatly somewhere
Rows of pre-war houses, streets of dark red stone
To the school on the corner, to the bridges
Or quickly along the park, to the shops
All the avenues near then,
all but one
Our avenue was endless
Our avenue was not going anywhere

At the end the world ended
No more houses but clouds
To where the distant sky
Faded into the horizon
Our avenue was endless
Our avenue was not going anywhere

And in the summer there was football and still light until late at night
Smell of mist from the pasture, grass and rusty barbed wire
And in the summer a man on a bicycle would get three quarters for the ice rink
Because in winter the polder wind blew so icy and mean
So that I knew for sure
Our avenue was not going anywhere



At the end the world ended
No more houses but clouds
To where the distant sky
Faded into the horizon
Our avenue was endless
Our avenue was not going anywhere

And some forty years later
Did it still work out?
Our avenue continues
And the neighborhood has been run down

At the end the world ended
No more houses but clouds
To where the distant sky
Faded into the horizon
Our avenue was endless
Our avenue was not going anywhere

Our avenue was endless
This street isn't going anywhere <|endoftext|> 
Everything seemed new last year
but every word weighed equally.
A new corner in every street
but the same houses next to each other.
At number one in good spirits,
at eighty I thought: never mind.
A suburb never comes into view,
who knows maybe next year.

An airplane can be a godsend
if you burned your ships.
I didn't have a travel destination,
I don't know where we landed.
It's empty to the horizon,
I'm overcome with emotions.
I know for sure now: I'm dying
not in a cot.

Never going back
i will never go back.
I don't know where I'm going.
Never going back
i will never go back.
But I know where I come from.
Never going back
i will never go back.



I still don't know where I am
and it doesn't really make any difference.
The landscape passes me by
and I pause for a moment.
I check my calendar and
I see that I am wasting my time.
It's time to hit the road again
I can go any way I want.

Never going back ...

Never going back ... <|endoftext|> 
Just act, just walk,
you free road user.
But let my child have his toy house
of cake and colored sugar.
No gull, I don't want your wings
not your freedom,
because all your heaven lies.

Your language is glittering like an eel
full of smooth silver words.
And look: they all pull
a slimy trail of murders.
No gull, I don't want your wings
not your freedom,
because all your heaven lies.



Raise the glass with wine, red
of the death of the Jew and the negro.
Quenches the shine of this carmine
the thirst of your army?
No gull, I don't want your wings
not your freedom,
because all your heaven lies.

This game that ever on blankets
for soldiers of soft tin.
Death whips like a child's hand
to death or victory.
No gull, I don't want your wings
not your freedom,
because all your heaven lies.

Vietnam, that's the name of your newest game,
you put in your blackest pieces.
And I forget my dreams
while making up my luck.
Oh gull, I don't want your wings
not your freedom,
as long as your heaven lies. <|endoftext|> 
I dream of that summer here in Greece
Every night, that fantasy again and again
Far from you, I still feel that romance here
I close my eyes, I can still hear our song

I had to go the vacation that was over
Away from you, so much grief together
If only I could be close to you for a little longer
When I am in dreamland, I hear our song again <|endoftext|> 
I wander through the gray streets and look around me a bit
I feel lonely and abandoned, but hey I will get over that
I would like you again in my arms, yes you very close to me
And let my heart warm by you, let us go through life anyway

refr .:
    Because as long as I can still dream of you, I feel that warmth around me
    As long as I can take on the whole world and I don't feel alone here
    As long as there is still a little love, then I know that happiness is always there
    As long as I only share my life with you



I really don't let my tears talk, a smile says a thousand more things
Because we still live to live, I learn that over and over again

refr. (3x)

Because as long as I can still dream of you, I feel that warmth around me
As long as I can take on the whole world and I don't feel alone here
As long as there is still a little love, then I know that happiness is always there <|endoftext|> 
Happiness is more than just a word
Happiness is what belongs to life
It is much more than a treasure found
Without a map but with your own heart
I still remember the day I found you
I didn't know there was such a beautiful thing
Although time may pass a little quickly
Yet you are still here with me

refr .:
    As long as there are days, as long as there are nights
    I live only for you, I give my heart to you
    As long as there are dreams, as long as there are wishes
    I want to be happy with you all my life



I pick the stars in the night for you
And whisper softly every now and then
Because of you I know that love is real
Happiness always comes sooner or later

refr. (2x)

I want to be happy with you all my life <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes I still look for the words
I don't know what to say
I had already lost so much anyway
until I ever met you
I will never forget that day
there you stood in front of me at once
from that day on I started to live
and being alone was over

[Chorus:]
You see all those sun rays
they are all for you
because what I was looking for I found
my flame of love that burns for you
all those thousand sun rays
they betray my happiness
the warmth they give you now
you give it back to me with love
I no longer look to tomorrow
because I enjoy today first
because of you, I don't worry now
you give me what I ask you for
I couldn't miss you
because of you tears became a smile
through life with you
i feel so happy every day



[Chorus]

[Chorus]
(+ repeat last 2 lines) <|endoftext|> 
Trapped by many tears, no more light to see
So many questions, to which you will not receive an answer
Sometimes they are small things that someone else really does not see
Sadness is all that is left

refr .:
    Life is like taking and giving, tears disappear with a smile
    Don't think about tomorrow if you have worries, learn to live by the day
    Everything in life only takes a while, hours pass, years go
    Days that will come that all your dreams also exist in reality



Lost in love, no future in sight
Don't stand still, the life that goes on
Although you sometimes feel lonely, some day there will be some light again
Because you always have friends for that

refr.

Tears disappear with a smile, learn to live by the day
Everything in life only takes a while, hours pass, years go
Days that will come that all your dreams also exist in reality
Days that will come that all your dreams also exist in reality <|endoftext|> 
(Frans Bauer and Marianne Weber)

Sometimes I have such an unparalleled day
It is as if the whole world is smiling at me
I don't see a cloud in the sky, all the gray has fled
Whether such a day was conceived for a fairytale
Everything I approach works immediately
It's as if the sun never shined more generously to me
And the reason is you, because you are there for me
Because of your love I am never alone for a day

refr .:
    It's like seventh heaven you know
    What I kind of live in
    And who can take care of that is you
    Without you it will never be so beautiful in my life
    But your love makes me happy every day



Most days are gray in winter
I see the birds on the run from so much cold
And the wind is blowing and it snows or hails again
It's about time that I find my warmth with you
Sometimes I have a very special feeling
But no one understands what I really feel now
Then I want to go anywhere all alone, without a goal
Because my heart gives away what I mean by this

refr. (2x)

Without you it will never be so beautiful in my life
But your love makes me happy every day <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes life is not easy for you
Tears that flow, to a great sea
A little love, that gives you the strength
I am so grateful to you for bringing that

refr .:
    Seven roses, seven tears
    Say I love you
    It's the things in life
    What happiness is built on
    Because a look deep into your eyes
    Is like heat from the sun
    Never flew away for an hour
    Because you kept winning my heart
    Seven roses, seven tears
    Say I love you
    It's the things in life
    Our strength is our loyalty



To live is to give what you feel
Even if it is difficult, by what you mean
Be open to it, the road is often long
Happiness is the best thing I always long for

refr. <|endoftext|> 
(Frans Bauer and Marianne Weber)

refr .:
    I wrote you seven letters
    Seven letters from that distant land
    But I never got an answer
    I am lonely on the quiet beach
    I see ships going and ships coming
    But unfortunately, you are always not there
    It's over with all my beautiful dreams
    Because you no longer love me

Every time
I think again
Why do you hurt my heart so much
Why don't you want to be with me anymore
Every time
I think again
If I could, I would fly to you now
To see if you still love me



refr.

Every time I think
Why do you hurt my heart so much
Why don't you want to be with me anymore
Every time I think
If I could, I would fly to you now
To see if you still love me.

Chorus:
Seven roses and seven years
Betrayed more than I can say
Not a thousand words, not a thousand tears
But a smile that can enchant me
Seven roses and seven years
With love, I think back to that time
And every star will continue to shine for you
It is the light that shines on our happiness

Sometimes I look for the words
I want to say to you
But with that I do you far too short

Because the language of love
You speak it with your heart
I hope this will never change with us



Chorus

Parlando:
Seven roses and seven years
Betrayed more than I can ever tell you
Not a thousand words, not a thousand tears
But a smile that can enchant me

Seven roses and seven years
With love, I think back to that time
And every star will continue to shine for you
It is the light that shines on our happiness
It is the light that shines on our happiness <|endoftext|> 
I've only known you a fortnight, but it's like I've known you much longer
Are you that woman from my dreams, this love is not just for a moment
No, your warmth, I want to feel and see your eyes all my life
That's why it hurts me so much that you're going to leave me like this
Even though I know one thing for sure, you will come here to me again

The farewell is getting closer every second
It's so strange, but soon you won't be with me anymore
If I sit alone you go home, but one day you will be home here
I see a tear in you, that makes me happy



Your eyes shine when I ask you
Come on, stop time for us today
Because then time will never pass
And then you are here with me for good
It may be too good to be true
But in my heart you are the sunshine
Because as long as I can dream of you, I want to be close to you

What you leave behind here is more than just anything
Because before you came I was alone and I had nothing
The sun brought us together and melted us into a loving couple
But real love always has some sadness

Your eyes shine when I ask you
Come on, stop time for us today
Because then time will never pass
And then you are here with me for good
It may be too good to be true
But in my heart you are the sunshine
Because as long as I can dream of you, I want to be close to you
Because as long as I can dream of you, I want to be close to you <|endoftext|> 
I've waited long enough, but I really don't have to anymore
It takes me so much strength again and again, this was the last time now
Even though you're begging at my door, I say you better go
Because I want to stand on my own two feet

refr .:
    I want to be free as a bird again and happy as a child
    Let me carry on the wings of the wind
    I want to shine like a star again, even if it is only so small
    Only then can I just be myself again



I no longer ignore it, I have already made a choice
Now leave me alone, you hit me too often
I don't forget you just like that, but I really had it
There was always something with you

refr. (2x)

Only then can I just be myself again <|endoftext|>

Are you disappointed again today
That's life
That's life
Then think well it is only for a moment
That's life
That's life
Sometimes you can no longer see the forest for the trees
Then do not give up in one go

[Chorus]
Know that the sun is shining for you too, if you're worried
Because tomorrow could be different again, don't be sad
Because the happiness that may well be hidden from you
As long as you see a light somewhere
Know that the sun is shining for you too, if you're worried
Because tomorrow could be different again, don't be sad
Because the happiness that may well be hidden from you
As long as you see a light somewhere



Jalalalalalala
Jalalalalalala

When you smile you feel much better
That's life
This is life ..... It is not always taking but also giving
That's life
That's life ..... Add a little water to the wine every now and then
Make a nice gesture even if it is very small

[Chorus]
Know that the sun is shining for you too, if you're worried
Because tomorrow could be different again, don't be sad
Because the happiness that may well be hidden from you
As long as you see a light somewhere
Know that the sun is shining for you too, if you're worried
Because tomorrow could be different again, don't be sad
Because the happiness that may well be hidden from you
As long as you see a light somewhere
As long as you see a light somewhere

You were born without anything
But what is then given to you
That is the basis of life
And helps you on your way

Even if your crib was in a shack
but you got love with it
Then you think for a moment later
That poverty was not so bad

We are all equal anyway
Happiness makes people rich
Although it often only revolves around money
That is not only what counts, just take a good look around you
Although someone else sometimes has a little more
Then I say every time
You cannot buy happiness with it
Because how you are that only counts

Not everyone gets a chance
Because elsewhere a lot is also suffered
So therefore be content here
And don't look at what another has



Because wealth is deep in your heart
Where you should build your life
It gives confidence to the future
It depends on how you experience it

We are all equal anyway
Happiness makes people rich
Although it often only revolves around money
That is not only what counts, just take a good look around you
Although someone else sometimes has a little more
Then I say every time
You cannot buy happiness with it
Because how you are that only counts

You cannot buy happiness with it
Because how you are that only counts <|endoftext|> 
I often wandered through no man's land
On the way, but where to
Looking for great happiness
Even though I didn't know how then
But I still found you
I still think about that day a lot
Storms that we withstood well
They have brought us prosperity

[refr .:]
What I want to tell you so badly
I say with dark red roses
Which I chose for you
With all my heart
Although that doesn't even seem like much now
They say more than 1000 words
You want so badly from me
Deep from my heart



Years pass quickly
If only time stood still
Eternally the flame of love burns
Being alone is so cold
A look very deep into your eyes
Betray to me what you really feel
You have never cheated on me again
And that is the best feeling

[refr.] [2x]

They say more than 1000 words
Deep from my heart <|endoftext|> 
I fought, but you couldn't
You lived your life, but you didn't see me
But still I kept hoping, thought, one day she sees it
But I've found out now, I don't have to wait
Because that makes no sense



refr .:
Why did you leave me, why did you leave
Was there no more to talk, why did I have to let you go
Everything seems to have changed now, the house is empty without you
Everything is so different now, I will not soon forget you
Still I miss all your warmth, don't get used to it
Because you were my life, I gave everything, tell me where you are

refr. <|endoftext|> 
What went wrong
No one got between us
But now you let yourself go
This could not have been avoided
Everyone makes a mistake
But you, I can't believe this
What I build my life on
Is that really not there anymore

refr .:
    Why do you keep going to the other
    I want to live, just like then
    Why have you suddenly changed
    Let's do everything over again



I gave my life to you
But you didn't take that
You broke words of loyalty
Did you even take that away from me?
But know that I forgive you
If you want to start over again
Say you still care about me
It is not too late yet

refr. (2x)

I want to live, just like then <|endoftext|> 
I would have liked to say so much to you saying goodbye to you I couldn't
How can I explain anything else to you, you leave me here with grief
Words that are now lost forever, I can never say what I want again
If you could only hear me one more time
That is no longer possible, it is now silent

Why can't you just be with me they say friends don't hurt each other
Still, I had to let you go here for good very far from me
Why can't you just be with me just now and then be very close to me
I live with what you left for me
Lots of little things, but great grief



I read your very last words here I would have liked to hear them from you
But life is sometimes a little different, everything is suddenly very cruelly disrupted
No, I am not ashamed of all my tears anyone who is allowed to see them
But I can't talk about it yet
That will come one day just maybe

Why can't you just be with me they say friends don't hurt each other
Still, I had to let you go here for good very far from me
Why can't you just be with me just now and then be very close to me
I live with what you left for me
Lots of little things, but great grief <|endoftext|> 
Wherever you were born
Everyone can hear it
Nothing to be ashamed of
That's how it should be

The stork had chosen
Your crib had no lace and roses
But a safe bed
That's how it should be

You got a lot of love
Money cannot buy that
Of those two people
Love and hope



That way you could live on
Give someone else your love
And you got older
That's how it should be

It's a cycle
Circles of love
To pass on
Love and hope

Wherever you were born
Everyone can hear it
Nothing to be ashamed of
That's how it should be <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes I have that somewhat lonely feeling
I don't really know what I want or feel anymore
Life is like a carousel
And in that you play a game

So I wonder does this make sense
Look into the mirror of life
I don't want to be bound for a moment
Your love was only pretense



refr .:
    I want to be free again as a bird
    What float on the wings of the wind
    And look for a life
    Where I find happiness and true love
    I want to be free again as a bird
    I can take on the whole world today
    Nobody can stop me from this
    Now let me do my thing
    I want to be free again as a bird
    Who wants to spread his wings

I shouldn't think I'm lonely
Because who knows the value of life
He knows it is a very hard fight
Full of happiness and misery
Build my future with my own stone
This is the only way to get through it properly
Go the way I so often go in dreams
Because one day it will be too late

refr. <|endoftext|> 
I only live here with my dreams
And look for that beautiful happiness
I often think when will you come
Or did you run away from me?
If you are at my door one day
Then I only have one question for you

Chorus:
Come Fly With Me
We go with two
Looking for paradise
The wind shows the way
Remember what I say
This will be our most beautiful journey
There our happiness awaits
Come on my flight
Because then we are together
Our dreams are now coming true
Take my hand and we'll be together
Come Fly With Me
We are going with the two of us
Looking for paradise.



I can hardly wait any longer
Even if my once will be rewarded
The silence those lonely nights
It's time you lived here with me
Desires they are getting stronger
I hope you can hear me somewhere

Chorus
Chorus <|endoftext|> 
What she says is beautiful:
Happy to see you again!
But I have nothing more to say
So well, goodbye, maybe
And I can feel my eyes burn
Knock them down quickly
She slips right out of my hands
For the very last time

Down, we're going down
Down, we're going down
And this time
Not at night
Not at breakfast
Or bad weather
We're going down
Down, we're going down

What she says is beautiful:
I don't speak that much anymore
What else I want to say
Sticks me in the throat
And I still want to do something beautiful
So I close my eyes
I think about her thoughts
And I think about her face



Down, we're going down
Down, we're going down
And this time
Not at night
Not at breakfast
Or bad weather
We're going down
Down, we're going down

Down, we're going down
Down, we're going down
And this time
Not at night
Not at breakfast
Or bad weather
Down, we're going down <|endoftext|> 
(Viva viva l'amore) You seemed to have walked out of a fairytale book
(Viva viva l'amore) I had been looking for you for far too long
That I had to find you here, somewhere far from me
In the land of the warm sun
I could not have known, but dreams do exist
I wish I could stay forever

refr .:
    Viva viva l'amore with your Spanish temperament you always enchant every guy
    Viva viva l'amore It's a good thing I'm on vacation here



(Viva viva l'amore) I want to dance through the night with you
(Viva viva l'amore) I have waited so long for this moment
You beg me for my love, your look that always catches me
You totally set me on fire
I can no longer be hacked, I have so longed for you
You make me a hungry man

refr. (3x) <|endoftext|> 
I went on vacation to Spain this year
To the flamingo, amor and the sun
I have lost my heart to the south
Although I knew I couldn't stay
And those Spanish guitars every night
It set me on fire again and again
So now and then just a dip in the water
Then you cooled down because what should you do
And the party was over
Then we continued under a loud song

refr .:
    E viva holiday
    The beach, the sun and the sea
    I feel happy here for a week or two
    E viva holiday
    The weather is with us
    The land of amore Espania ole



refr.

In the afternoon I had a siesta
Because otherwise I really couldn't keep it up anymore
Fiesta all evening and nights
Just enjoying yourself
The senoritas with jet black hair
They were all temperament
Such a Spanish beauty who brings you total ecstasy
You feel like a real guy
It's like all my dreams
I feel happy to be here in Spain

refr. (2x) <|endoftext|> 
No mountain was too high for me ..
Not a word that I lied to you ..
I can't miss you.

Do you want to go your own life ..
And just leave me here ...
Well ... you are mistaken ...
Happiness is more than just anything ...
Were all those years in vain ...
Are you going to leave me now ... ??
Have I lost you forever now ..
And you leave me in solitude ..
But I still want to talk to you ...

Chorus ..:

How can I forget you now .. ??
Wherever I am I hear your voice ..
The whole world should know ...
I'm still crazy about you ...
I can't say goodbye to you.
Don't ask me for one last kiss.
I want to share my life with you ...
Give us that chance ... just like then ...

I've done whatever I can ..
The lies I once made up ...
Did I forget something .. ??
Tell me what I did wrong ..
I won't let you go here for nothing ..
Please let me know ..
I gave you everything you asked for.
But apparently that wasn't enough.
But that's no reason anyway ..
I've never seen my mistakes ..
Love might make me blind.
But you were still satisfied ..

Chorus ..:

How can I forget you .. ??
Wherever I am I hear your voice ..
The whole world should know ...
I'm still crazy about you ...
I can't say goodbye to you.
Don't ask me for one last kiss.
I want to share my life with you ..
give us that chance ... just like then ... <|endoftext|> 
The flashing light still exists
But it no longer warns you
You threw your eyes closed
It was a hit the first time
And one thing I know for sure
That it was always stupid, the rush and the hassle
You can wait again
Because you are no longer tired

You don't have to do anything anymore
Nowhere anymore
Nowhere to go
You don't have to do anything anymore
Nowhere anymore
Nowhere to go

From now on you are different
A wanderer of the soul
You no longer count the days
And you reinvent the wheel
That fits your car, and pleasantly surprised
That it improves after such a long time
Throw your watch in the water
Because you will never lose it



You don't have to do anything anymore
Nowhere anymore
Nowhere to go
You don't have to do anything anymore
Nowhere anymore
Nowhere to go

The flashing light still exists
It has been fixed
Take that rock out of your pocket
Because it no longer warns you

You don't have to do anything anymore
Nowhere anymore
Nowhere to go
You don't have to do anything anymore
Nowhere anymore
Nowhere to go <|endoftext|> 
To love life is to laugh at each other
Going out together for a while, it doesn't matter how or where
You live to enjoy every hour of the day
Everyone should know, be happy that you can live

refr .:
    Today I am taking the flowers outside for a while
    Today I turn the whole world upside down
    Today I'm going out and my boss can whistle at me
    Today I'm just looking for a cozy place to stay

Same every day, never ending
At seven o'clock the alarm goes off, time to get up again
A cup of coffee and a newspaper, it's the same song over and over again
But today I stay comfortable, no my boss doesn't see me



refr.

Nobody can stop me, today I will continue
You live to live, fun comes first
Tomorrow it will be different, then I will be ready again
Today they can go to hell, because tomorrow may be too late

refr.

Today I'm just looking for a cozy place to stay <|endoftext|> 
The sun, the sand, the heat and the calm river
The silence and the dryness and the emptiness of this here
Heaven and earth, the wisdom of the land
And a man's wisdom, that's enough

There is nothing I am waiting for
Tomorrow it will remain night
I reflected on my concerns and the world
And all the times I lay awake
I decided
What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

The ground, the grass, the roads to the horizon that vibrate
Time is space here, depth here is wild
The nonsense and the necessity, they are approaching the limit
The love of one person was enough for me

There is nothing I am waiting for
Tomorrow it will remain night
I reflected on my concerns and the world
And all the times I lay awake
I decided
What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

There is nothing I am waiting for
Tomorrow it will remain night
I reflected on my concerns and the world
And all the times I lay awake
I decided
What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

There is nothing I am waiting for
Tomorrow it will remain night
I reflected on my concerns and the world
And all the times I lay awake
I decided
What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day



What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

before death ........ <|endoftext|> 
It's always a struggle:
Or I choose loneliness
A strange duck in every bite
With the idea that no one is looking
Or I cling to my friends
Stand in their light or shadow
I've already done everything
But the doubts remain

My sleep full of bad dreams
Every night was too long
But all my ghosts and demons
No longer scare me

Monsters never sleep
So I just go to bed
Monsters never sleep
I did not set the alarm
Because they'll wake me up

It's always a fight
Whether you stand up for your rights
Or that you complain but not really
Something changes what is said
There is always someone who
Make you feel like you are not
Be worth it or something
Those are the monsters you see



My sleep full of bad dreams
Every night was too long
But all my ghosts and demons
No longer scare me

Monsters never sleep
So I just go to bed
Monsters never sleep
I did not set the alarm
Because they'll wake me up

Monsters never sleep
So I just go to bed
Monsters never sleep
I did not set the alarm
Because they will wake me up <|endoftext|> 
I find myself again
At a very boring party
In an unknown room
Where I've never been before
Still, I'm not leaving here
My legs are as heavy as lead
And so I'll just sit here
Well, I'm dying a bit difficult

Hard dead
I only leave a sinking ship last
Hard dead
I want to get off but never dare to hurry
Hard dead
Leaving a sinking ship is only the last thing
Hard dead

I find myself again
Talking about nothing
With an unknown guy
And I just think about my bike
Who is waiting for me
In the fresh air
And I just sit in the smoke
And I'm not running

Hard dead
I only leave a sinking ship last
Hard dead
I want to get off but never dare to hurry
Hard dead
I only leave a sinking ship last
Hard dead



A chat with the host
My glass filled again
Nobody even gets up
And I'm really losing my patience

Still, I just sit here
And I find myself again
Afraid to quit

Stronger stories
About drinking and a lot of weed
It's a sad spectacle
And it is not cozy
A double tongue tells me:
Success is only a celebration
When the sun comes up again
And the police have been

Hard dead
Leaving a sinking ship is only the last thing
Hard dead
I want to get off but never dare to hurry
Hard dead
I only leave a sinking ship last
Hard dead (2x) <|endoftext|> 
Listen to the wind.
There is no such thing as real silence.
The radio plays softly.
The most beautiful song you have ever heard.
Here is that feeling again.
Of hope and confusion and arms full of love.
Here is that feeling again.
That will take you further.

Maybe see you tomorrow.
Maybe you're gone.
There is something in you that tells you if it is time.
Time to get out.
Maybe see you tomorrow.
Don't think about today.
Only take with you what you have to wear and where you
Really can not go outside.
Maybe see you tomorrow.

The sounds around you.
Listen and hear how they wave and break.
Someone is whispering softly.
The sweetest word you've ever heard.
Here is that feeling again.
Of hope and confusion with way too many opportunities.
And here is that feeling again.
That you can always search.



Maybe see you tomorrow.
Maybe you're gone.
There is something in you that tells you if it is time.
Time to get out.
Maybe see you tomorrow.
Don't think about today.
Only take what you have to wear and where you,
Really can not go outside.
Maybe see you tomorrow.

Maybe see you tomorrow.
Maybe you're gone.
There is something in you that tells you if it is time.

Really can not go outside.
Maybe see you tomorrow. <|endoftext|> 
Here in the tall grass
no one can see us
no one wonders where we are.

I have resigned myself to you.
We do hear cars,
but they are far away
we have plenty of time.

Maybe not eternity
Maybe not eternity
But long enough for me

I see the clouds floating
Think of the imprint of our bodies,
next to each other.

And when we get up it's over.
Still we won't go away
we'll be there for a long time.

Maybe not eternity
Maybe not eternity



What will stay with me later,
month after month,
year after year.

Not the smile on your mouth
not your hands, not your eyes,
don't put your t-shirt on the floor

but the plastic butterfly in your hair

Maybe not eternity
Maybe not eternity

Maybe not eternity
Maybe not eternity

But it's long enough for me
It's long enough for me

There in the tall grass, no one can see us <|endoftext|> 
There is really nothing that cannot happen today
Doors swing open
Windows close
And whole worlds perish
Because they asked for it
Without knowing
And always the question

Whether it is ever justified
It's a fight
Just to be somewhere
To live and live
And if only for a moment
To really be human
And then disconnect from your place and time

There is really nothing that cannot change today
Cities flood
Buildings collapse
Blue skies are drifting
In dark brown eyes
For no good reason
And always the question



Whether it is ever justified
It's a fight
Just to be somewhere
To live and live
And if only for a moment
To really be human
And then disconnect from your place and time

(Music)

Whether it is ever justified

I look further
now that the day is getting shorter again.
I'm freer
although I am running out of time more and more.
I'm milder
I am also calmer
While you paint with your words
and show me something new again.

You're more beautiful
than I've ever seen you.
You are beautiful,
you are more than I deserve.
You are further
than I could ever be.
You're braver than I am
because you never think of an end.

I look further
to the sea ahead
I feel better that I am free
and therefore never obliged to do anything.
I go much further, much further, much further
than I have ever dared to do.
And I don't panic anymore
because there is always that kiss again.



You're more beautiful
than I've ever seen you.
You are beautiful,
you are more than I deserve
You are getting close to perfection
which I have always denied.
You're braver than me
just because you're with me.

You're more beautiful
than I've ever seen you.
You are beautiful,
you are much more than I deserve.
You are much further, much further, much further
than I could ever be.
You're braver than me
because you never think of an end. <|endoftext|> 
you can give me what you have
your house your fireplace
your heart and soul
a spin on the wheel of life
a big secret or a recipe
for success and mountains of money
a sea of ​​love called blind
a good turn of fate
all the flowers in the field
you can do anything for me
we caress kisses just as much
make love to me until we're whole
one in one million
but this is what it is
sometimes i'm hard sometimes i'm cool
I don't say what I mean
I love you with all my heart
and it cannot be more



you can be anything to me
my angel of pleasure
merging into the now and here
the perfect medicine
against depression against pain
be my bringer of happiness
you who fix what I broke
a buoy and lifeline
but this is what it is
sometimes i'm hard
sometimes i'm cool
I don't say what I mean
but this is what it is
sometimes i'm soft
sometimes i'm hot
and then you lie in my arms
I love you with all my heart
it cannot be more
you can stand gorgeous next to me
many times
than you ever would for anyone
you can watch me remotely
be or seem blissful
and reconciled to yourself

but this is what it is
sometimes shaky and confused
I love you with all my heart
it cannot be more
this is what it is
sometimes shaky and confused
I love you with all my heart
but it cannot be more
but this is what it is
this is what it is
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
it cannot be more <|endoftext|> 
I've been expecting you for a long time
The end of the street
Was never far away
But dear, I was still scared
That you wouldn't come
Or would pass me by
then I just dreamed something
That, however, was you

Nothing changes
Nothing improves
The desire is there
Then be here with me
And now that I can see you
I ask

More of you
Crawl under my house and stay there
More of you
In exchange for this broken body

You already saw where I was
The end of time
Was so far away
And I put words in my mouth
Who really didn't mean anything to you
but sounds are themselves
And they lead you to me
Not always, but this time



Nothing changes
Nothing improves
The desire is there
Then be here with me
And now that I can see you
I ask

More of you
Crawl under my house and stay there
More of you
In exchange for this broken body

I become more of you
Get under my skin and stay there
More of you
With all my heart and soul
More of you <|endoftext|> 
You look down
You just asked me
Whether my hands are that cold too
Or do I have to be you for that?

I still owe the answer
You shut up and wait patiently
Until I finally grab your hand
And we both know:
Yours looks like red-hot
That's how cold mine is
And I say:

Dear darling, keep going
Dear darling, keep going
Dear darling, keep going
Where you left off
Dear darling, keep going
Dear darling, keep going
Dear darling, keep going
Where you left off
Don't leave, but stay a while longer

You look at the ground
Like a doubting bride
You can't get it out
It gets stuck in your mouth again
That one high word
I did not hear it
I did not hear it



I look away
And I just stare at my shoes
I look away
To tie my shoelaces
To get up
To leave
But you say:

Dear darling, keep going
Dear darling, keep going
Dear darling, keep going
Where you left off
Dear darling, keep going
Dear darling, keep going
Dear darling, keep going
Where you left off

Continue! Continue! <|endoftext|> 
MORE FROM YOU (my love)

I've been expecting you for a long time
The end of the street
Was so far away
But dear, I was still scared
That you wouldn't come
Or would pass me by
Then I just dreamed something
That, however, was you

Nothing changes
Nothing improves
The desire is there
Then be here with me

Now that I can see you
I ask
More of you
Get under my skin and stay there
More of you
In exchange for this broken body



You already saw where I was
The end of time
Was so far away
And I put words in my mouth
Who really didn't mean anything to you
But sounds are themselves
And they lead you to me
Not always, but this time

Nothing changes
Nothing improves
The desire is there
Then be here with me

Now that I can see you
Am I
More of you
Get under my skin and stay there
More of you
In exchange for this broken body

More of you
Get under my skin and stay there
More of you
In exchange for this broken body
I become more of you
Get under my skin and stay there
More of you
With all my heart and soul
More of you! <|endoftext|> 
When I'm silent, I want to say so much, say a lot more
Than it seems, that's me
But if I keep silent, that doesn't mean
that I don't listen to what you actually think

Okay I know sometimes I'm too inconsiderate
Do your best, I forget to compliment again
While you are the sweetest!

Chorus:
But when you look at me, you don't just see
Just a man of stone in there
From the outside I look hard, but give it a shot
And let it hurt my man's heart.

When I talk I wanna say so much, say a lot more
Than it actually seems
And when I talk, it means that I am not listening
Because I can't do anything at once.



And yes I know sometimes I don't hear what you say
If you have the floor, I forget to give you my attention again
While you are the sweetest!

Chorus:
But when you look at me, you don't just see
Just a man of stone in there
From the outside I look hard, but give it a shot
And let it hurt my man's heart.

The man I am now, the man I want to be
A kid and a guy, I'll be both!

Chorus:
But when you look at me, you don't just see
Just a man of stone in there
From the outside I look hard, but give it a shot
And let it hurt, hurt

But when you look at me, you don't just see
Just a man of stone in there
Nothing is what it seems, so don't get confused
And find yourself in my man's heart. <|endoftext|> 
I know nothing about the world.
Nothing but what I hear and see, nothing but something
I read
I don't know any other countries, even though I've been there.
I don't know big cities,
Except from the books
except from TV.
I don't know any other city
than the city where I live.


But she sends me cards from Madrid. And a letter comes from Moscow
With the most beautiful stories. God, she's so sweet
Yesterday from Lisbon I miss you and a kiss.
Today from Prague a cat bell, because there is so much to do
And tomorrow, when the postman has found my house again
Then she fills my heart with all the love from London.




I know nothing about the world.
Nothing but what I hear and see, nothing but what I feel
I live from day to day, without fear and without purpose.
I do not know faraway countries
Except from my atlas, I dream it every night
But I only dream the countries where she once thought of me.

Like a beautiful and great faith.
On the wall of my mind
A world map is waiting.
Until she returns.
Traveling with her in my head
I put flags in the earth.
Same color, same value.

But she sends me cards from Madrid.
And a letter comes from Moscow
With the most beautiful stories.
God, she's so sweet.
Yesterday from Lisbon "I miss you" and a kiss.
Today from Prague a cat bell, because there is so much to do.
And tomorrow, when the postman has found my house again
Then she fills my heart with all the love from London <|endoftext|> 
I still remember everything about that day
If it was at least one day
Because this story takes place
Out of time
I remember your smile
If it was a laugh at least
Because your grimace slipped off
I lost you
You were gone
And it just seemed
As if you never existed
Did I invent you myself?

You were then, you are now
You are in a bubble
You were there and you are here
And that bubble floats far away
But keep you alive

I can still see the empty glass
If it was at least one glass
Because you pay for all drinks
Out of time
I remember a joke
If it was a joke at least
Because the laughter slipped off
I lost you
You're gone
Sometimes it just is
As if I never existed
Did you invent me yourself?

I was then, I am now
I'm in a bubble
I was there and I am here
And that bubble floats far away
But keeps us alive



Everything then is everything now
It's in a bubble
Everything there is everything here
And that bubble floats far away
But keeps us alive <|endoftext|> 
Look out the window
See me standing here in the snow
I have come to laugh
to the blunder of the century
Let your husband sleep peacefully
Then we have some time
Stay warm by the window
I just want to say something
Or actually I want to know something.

Got everything you wanted now?
You woke up with a smile
He often says I love you

Hold him if you are sometimes scared
He knows your fear and your grief
Just shake your head, dear
No wonder you left me

I'm leaving
I'm going to walk
I'm going to walk until the sun comes up
I'm leaving
Until the sun catches up with me
Walk until the sun comes up
And until it shines.



Just stay inside
It's fine this way
I wanted to see you last time
What we used to dream together, half of us don't remember anymore.
I hope you will be happy
I hope I am not mistaken
I hope I will be happy seeing what I miss so much

He'll hold you sometimes when you're scared
He knows your fear and your grief
Just shake your head, dear
No wonder you left me

I'm going to walk until the sun comes up
Until the sun catches up with me
Walk until the sun comes up
Until it shines <|endoftext|> 
On the terrace of prosperity
Is something strange on the menu
That you can drink bottomless
Because you can't go any deeper
Then the cellar full of wine
Where we all are already

Let's go then, you and me
When the evening stretches out
against the sky
Let's go then, you and me
Stretched out to your body
against mine

On the terrace of prosperity
There is no drink on the menu
Because there is only a donation
From always the same can
In the glow of dark light you drink with your eyes closed

Let's go then, you and me
When the evening stretches out
against the sky
Let's go then, you and me
Stretched out to your body
against mine



You know everything gives up the ghost
But the wine most of all
At the end of the party
Have we all been there

Let's go then, you and me
When the evening stretches out
against the sky
Let's go then, you and me
Stretched out to your body
against mine

Let's go then ... <|endoftext|> 
The flame is always burning
The oil never runs out
In the lamp here on my table
That sheds light on my hands
And the empty sheet of paper
Read carefully what I write to you
Because I can only do it once
I don't have the strength anymore
But the flame is always burning

I am writing you this because I want you to know my name
And that you know how I feel
And that you know who I am
Because I wish I was someone else
Because I wish I existed
existed for you



The flame is always burning
But the book has to be closed someday
And the lamp here on my table
Warms my stiff hands
And put the pen on the paper
I know what I'm writing to you
A love letter out of desperation
You have to get out of my body
But the flame is always burning

I'm writing you this
Because I want you to know my name
And knows about my feelings
And that you know who I am
Because I wish I was someone else
Because I wish I existed
existed for you

Forever Yours <|endoftext|> 
I was out, the penny dropped
The blow still flew
But I knew who I would become

I let go of them, the cold numbers
They still checked me out
But I didn't follow the signs

Later when I grow up I stay who I am (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Later when I recognize myself I know who I am (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)

It was there, but it wouldn't come
Waiting for the day
I knew I couldn't force it

I touched what I dreamed about
I did not know what I saw
Until I realized I had to sing

Later when I grow up I stay who I am (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Later when I recognize myself I know who I am (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)



I am alone how could it be otherwise, I remember what I was looking for
It's later now
And around me, everything has changed
But I still know that boy

It's later now (oh oh oh oh)
It's later now (oh oh oh oh)
It's later now (oh oh oh oh)
It's later now (oh oh oh oh)
It's later now (oh oh oh oh)

Later when I grow up I stay who I am (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Later when I recognize myself I know who I am (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Later when I grow up I stay who I am (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Later when I recognize myself I know who I am (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh) <|endoftext|> 
In the host of the night
When it is quiet everywhere
So quiet you think about death
Then I'm still wide awake
Bent over glasses
And my thirst is still too great

There is one kind of happiness
Who will never drown
She still won't leave me alone
It is late and it will
Also always stay
So that I also like the last one

With the glass on my heart
That will always burn
What it requires
Love and drink

In the heat of the day
When it is quiet everywhere
So quiet it looks like noise
Look up to the sky
Which is then red, yellow and blue
And that turns wildly around the earth



There is one kind of happiness
Who will never be pushed aside
She still loves my bed
In a corner of the room
The bottle is already waiting
It must have been prepared overnight

With the glass on my heart
That will always burn
What it requires
Love and drink

With the glass on my heart
That will always burn
What it requires
Love and drink <|endoftext|> 
There is a great shortage of beds
Because a woman is trying to save
What a man had drowned for a long time
Because he was in the dark

A man who falls cannot be caught
If he's not dying of desire
To a woman he never saw before
Only because she was under

Leave the light on
Leave the light on



Nothing is more blind than two lovers
Who never slept together before
The bonfire usually goes out much too soon
And rarely gets high enough

Save the pillow and the sheet
Stay close to it like a dog
The night is long, the day is short
Make sure it never gets dark again

Leave the light on
Leave the light on
Leave the light on
Leave the light on
Leave the light on <|endoftext|> 
On the day the dog died
Suddenly the first snow fell
The air was cold and gray like lead
And the seagulls and the crows were crying softly
That it was better
Then fight over and over again
Against anything that keeps hurting
And I only thought about then

That time you and me
And the labrador
Went for a run on the beach
With a perfect spring sun
We hand in hand
And the barking of the dog

When I got here
With a spade in my hand
I stood still at the tree
That bent high over the edge
And I looked into the depth like that
Where the labrador would sleep

There is nothing more that can hurt
And I only think about then
That time you and me
And the labrador
Went for a run on the beach
With a perfect spring sun
We hand in hand
And the barking of the dog

Which was a bridge between us
And now that he's gone, it's winter
And nothing remains
Of what connected you and me



I curse the white blanket
Spread out on the ground
I watched for hours
But I didn't see the dog
Could ever bring back to me
And neither does your love

There is nothing more that can hurt
And I only think about then
That time you and me
And the labrador
Went for a run on the beach

You and me
And the labrador
Running on the beach

You and me
And the labrador
Running on the beach

You and me
And the labrador
Running on the beach

You and me <|endoftext|> 
I'm hanging on the billiards
from this dark brown pub
And slowly it becomes light
is it late or early again?
It's quiet on the street
the bartender rinses the glasses
And you drink another beer
and I see everything straight crooked

Last lap, last lap
I didn't find anything tonight
Last lap, last lap
Weighted but found too light

One more time to the toilet,
I stumble sat down the stairs
I was nowhere with you
until the mood broke
It's gonna be nothing between us
I have noticed that by now
So I got a lot of water
so dealt with the disappointment

Last lap, last lap
I didn't find anything tonight
Last lap, last lap
Weighted but found too light



I'm hanging on the billiards
from this dark brown pub
And slowly it becomes light
is it late or early again?

Last lap, last lap
I didn't find anything tonight
Last round, very last round
Weighted but found too light

Last round <|endoftext|> 
it is no longer possible
I've already packed my things
three days alone
I've already had it
let me go even if you give me a million
I do not love you anymore

let me go
I can not take it anymore
it does not work
it doesn't click
never touch me again
and if you try
you go to it

I do not want to see you anymore
now someone else gets that ten
I never find it enough
than normal

Chorus:



listen to the radio
thriller on TV
don't look like that
now pack your bags
you know you have to go

chorus 2x

guitar solo

maybe that last kiss
Do what you have to do
now go 2x
even though you cry to death
you can't get in anymore <|endoftext|> 
Stay - Low To The Ground

We want to go up
We want to see where we are
And what is ours
We want to go up
Where the air is sometimes still clean
And the sun always shines

We want to go up
We want to see what is good
Away from the fire and smoke
We have to go up
Whoever is to blame must pay
And who is not to blame

Close to the ground
Where the angels fall
And where peoples rise
Close to the ground
Where we make love and fight
Where we bleed and die

We want to go up
We want to see where we are
When everything will change
We want to go up
Before it is too late
And the sun will soon disappear



We want to go up
But something is holding us back
Turns one arm behind us
We have to go up
One elbow across
Nobody wants to go back

Close to the ground
Where the angels fall
And where peoples rise
Close to the ground
Where we make love and fight
Where we bleed and die

Close to the ground
Where the angels fall
And where peoples rise
Close to the ground
Where we make love and fight
Where we bleed and die

Close to the ground
Where the angels fall
And where peoples rise
Close to the ground
Where we make love and fight
Where we bleed and die <|endoftext|> 
see they go the sour men
see them hanging in their coats
plastic bags with the bulls
where there is a wall hangs a puddle
see them sliding through the streets
with their bottle at half past nine
no one wants to smell their skies
no one wants to see their porem

see they go the sour men
see them fumes in the cold
all those big dreamed plans
ten o'clock in the morning and already blue
see them waiting on platforms
on the train that will never go
see them searching the bins
according to the sense of existence



sour men sour men
it's the blues and no shower
the suffering and the drink
rather sour and in the oil
then office worker on a sofa

see they go the sour men
nowhere to nowhere from nowhere
on their run-down shoes
because of the sour-man existence
hear them sing in the streets
of loneliness and drink
hear them talk to themselves
with their one and a half teeth

it's the blues and no shower
the suffering and the drink

honey here I am again
later than ever
you sleep i am drunk
I never learn
couple of friends couple of beers
then the night flies
and I don't think about it
if you wait for me

I'm an asshole too
I'm doing everything wrong
it is a mystery to me
that you love me
but I thank heaven
that's where you come from
you are the sun
the stars the moon



and I love you
sweetheart

honey here I am again
later than ever
you wake up drunk
I never learn
there is so much to do dear
and it goes on and on
and I don't want to miss anything
because that's what it's for

and I love you
sweetheart
as much as I can
that is not that much
and what good is it
but I love you
sweetheart <|endoftext|> 
that's good
here with you
that's good
out of the cold
outside the world
and nothing left to do
here with you
that's good



that's good
I caress your back
that's good
you caress me back
outside the world
and whatever you do
here with you
that's good
here with you
that's good

that's good
here with you

out of the cold
love is simple
you can feel the glow
here with you

Who says a lot
Lult also sometimes hit
If you never say anything
That doesn't work that often

Whoever talks and talks
Sometimes goes wrong
If you look closely first
Do you know what time it is

So if the truth there
In the middle
I open my mouth
Close again just in time

Don't say it so quickly
Don't say it so soon
What I'm telling now
So I say it now

Like never a man before
Never been a woman
I love you

Don't say it so quickly
Don't say it so soon
But I do know
How I love you

Like never a man before
Never been a woman
Can have hewn
I love you



I love you
I love you
I love you

If you prefer to be silent
Then banter sells
Chances you will get
What you silently hope for

Who really wants to hear
What he just asked for
Usually needs a silent
Half word enough

Don't say it so quickly
Never say it so soon
That's why now
And that is why

Like never a man before
Never been a woman
Can have hewn
I love you

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

Like never a man before
Never been a woman
I love you

seven lives

give me seven lives

give me a life to roam
in the unprecedented area
to find what you pursue
to see what you never see

one to take up arms
against hunger and pain
to bring down the systems
that are the cause of it

seven lives
give me seven lives

one for lather free
along the edge of existence
ringing through the brown life
with my mates and the moon

one to sit on a mountain
watching the world turn
how the water flows to the sea
how the wind blows the clouds



seven lives
give me seven lives
seven lives
have to see I get seven
give me seven lives
seven lives
and I live them all

one to train endlessly
for that one moment
to score the final goal
from a cross from a friend Rick

and a life for all women
bow deep and my hat
even deeper for them to take off
because the women are good

seven lives
give me seven lives
seven lives
have to see I get seven
give me seven lives
seven lives

and a life for my wildest dreams
to tell my dad
to ask him: what do you mean?
if he nods and says yes yes

one for the beauty between people
screaming out with the band
if people want to dance
in a packed tent

and a life to come home to
with the one I love
never to have to leave
with my daughter and my wife

seven lives
give me seven lives
seven lives
have to see I get seven
give me seven lives
seven lives
and I live them all <|endoftext|> 
the fear experienced by others
I suffer from it like no other
I am unsure step by step
because I can't ignore it

I make faces for the other
watch me go so fast and strong
nobody knows me like that
nobody can handle me just like that



I'm lonely for sure
nobody's gonna take me out of here
why would anyone be sure
what is left for the other

I will destroy the weak brothers
weak sisters that's me
never knocked over for sure
never insecure always strong

but in the depths of my mind
I want to be anxious and weakened
I am buttery insecure
without mask, stem or heel <|endoftext|> 
the telephone
and I answer
I say hello
it remains silent for a moment
then she says
I'm coming
like you
if you want at least

she comes back
she comes back
my love is coming back
tomorrow everything will be over
baby is coming back

all those nights
nights without end
all those nights
in a hopeless struggle
very alone
to myself
she comes back
she arrives right on time



she comes back
she comes back
my love is coming back
tomorrow everything will be over

and the slow days are over
she takes things out of my cup
it does not change the world
but the view on it

she comes back
she comes back
my love is coming back
tomorrow everything will be over
baby is coming back
she comes back to me <|endoftext|>

do it for show

in the chaos and madness
in the hall of the central
sits the woman with plastic bags
she watches it all

she sees people - all those people
people from all over
with a purpose and a destination
sees them coming - sees them go

sees them doing and sees them pressing
in the hustle and bustle of the day
sees it all happen
and constantly laughs

who doesn't smile
who doesn't smile
who doesn't smile
who sees the people

in the shadow of the chip shop
on the edge of existence
among the free-range and junkies
the woman sits and looks at them

she sees children and their parents
she sees gentlemen from the office
she sees tourists with their backpacks
everyone wants to run



she sees lines at counters
ladies in their good looks
and she can't help it either
that she always laughs like that

who doesn't smile
who doesn't smile
who doesn't smile
who sees the people

in the chaos and madness
the woman sees the people go
who misses the train must stay
and never comes from here again

I also have to catch my train
I need to get started
when she sees me walking past
she is doubled over with laughter

who doesn't smile
who doesn't smile
who doesn't smile
who sees the people

who is not smiling? <|endoftext|> 
I don't have to leave yet
because I have nowhere to go
you can ask me anything
but don't ask me how
Who knows may say
but you don't hear it
those who don't know can sing it

although I sit still here
I do what i can
I was planning a lot more
but that just won't happen
you're getting close
but then you are not there yet
Who knows may say
who does not know
may it sing in song



I don't have to leave yet
because where can you go
there are friends with cars
but I don't have one
lost direction
and there is no way
Who knows may say

the world continues to run
the world is going crazy
the world is getting full
and I spin my shit
I'm here now
but also prefer not to
Who knows may say
who does not know
may it sing with a song

I do have an opinion
but it takes an hour
the turnips are done
and the grapes are sour
the amstel fleet

you wanted to fly
without wings
uninhibited by gravity
away the laws
loosen the reins
in an endless night

regardless of the future
and past
you wanted to float without a jump
drunk on it
the full present
just win for the gong

who wants it fiercely
whoever wants it fiercely can get it too



you wanted to dream
without sleeping
not tormented by feasibility
feel how
in all your fiber
every second
taps and counts

who wants it fiercely
no smoke without fire
no fire without smoke
whoever wants it fiercely can get it too

you wanted to fly
without wings
not inhibited by size or power
away the laws
loosen the reins
in an endless night
who wants it fiercely

I got where you wanted
that I had to come
you wanted to see me
and now we are here
now you turn up your nose
and carry on with your dreams
you sit back
with your glass of white wine

what else
what more do you want me to do?

I expose you my soul
you yawn about a fire
how can I give that
with my soul in my hand
I scream my throat red
you take another wine
you sit back
as if I were the newspaper
as if I were a newspaper



what else
what more do you want me to do?
tell me how

my heart can't get bigger
my soul cannot be bleaker
and my pants no further down

I play the fool for you
i sing and i dance for you
I'm gonna fuck myself for you
and I hold myself tall
but I'm not singing a crack yet
I'm not getting a tear yet
in your glass of white wine
you sit back
and I'm falling for you, I'm falling for you

what else
what more do you want me to do?
tell me how <|endoftext|> 
yesterday i was nowhere
and here again today
in the midst of things
now I count for four again

what a woman
what a woman cannot do

yesterday I was devastated
now I can't go wrong
I couldn't laugh about anything anymore
now I can cry with happiness

what a woman
what a woman cannot do

she can make you float like gin
and drop like a stone
it can make and break a man
she can do it all
like a woman alone

must have been dreaming
must have slept
must have walked
in a dream that I was sleeping
and everything was simple

must have slept

no time to waste
a wrong move
is potentially fatal
it's hard against hard
teeth or molars
death to the waist
or death to the disease
and I became



awake in a strange world
what is happening here?
awake in a strange world
with women of iron
and men of steel

this will never work out
this will never be right

If only that were true

I close my eyes
Let my thoughts go to you
I'll see you again
Standing before me in all your beauty
Beading your teeth
Waving your hair
You are almost with me and I think
If only that were true

I can fantasize you
I can dream you what I want
But I get my desire
Not quiet to you with that
If only it wasn't over
If only it wasn't over
That it will all happen
Between you and me



If only that were true
If only that were true
If only that were true

Between dream and reality
It is unevenly distributed
Hard to believe
What a person does not imagine
We tried
We've done everything we can
We wanted it different
But it did not go that way

If only that were true
If only you were here
If only that were true <|endoftext|> 
how that is now
you will never find out
for your feeling up to your neck in shit
you can't figure it out
it does not seem to be allowed
you prefer everything
anything rather than this

but I say
don't despair - don't despair
soon it will all be different again
and maybe better than ever
so don't despair - never despair

you're the dick
it will always stay that way
that's the price for all your messing around

and then suddenly
this only needs to happen
and everything is beautiful
it's going great and everything is so beautiful



I say
don't despair - don't despair
soon it will all be different again
and maybe better than ever
so don't despair - never despair

one day child
the next bump
the higher the top
the deeper the valley
you're nowhere like that
you get everywhere

now you sit still
soon you will no longer be possible
that's how life goes
for those who want everything from it

don't despair - don't despair
soon it will all be different again
and maybe better than ever
so don't despair
never despair <|endoftext|> 
Where there is no will, I am gone - De Dijk

For those who want, nothing will go down
For those who want, early never gets late
Sharp edges become rounder,
the silence starts talking

For those who want nothing is a miracle,
can do without it very well
If you want, if you want
if you only want it to go like this

But where there's no will you can't forget
Can't you forget, you're out of luck
Then you should know for yourself
Where there is no will, I am gone



It is daring to keep dreaming,
look further than you see
And whether anything will ever come of it
It never hits if you don't shoot



There is gold in the ordinary,
in the everyday beauty
If you want, if you want
if you want, go ahead or not

But where there's no will you can't forget
Can't you forget, you're out of luck
Then you should know for yourself
Where there is no will, I am gone



I can be poked for everything
in for every good idea
When the mind is there, the passion,
I like nothing more than to participate

Where there's no will you can't forget
Can't you forget, you're out of luck
Then you should know for yourself
Where there is no will, I am gone

Where there's no will you can't forget
Can't you forget, you're out of luck
You should know for yourself
Where there is no will, I am gone <|endoftext|> 
where are the stars in the sky
that I have seen standing there before
where is venus

remember that night in the park
by the light of the full moon
that we then wanted to count the stars
oh oh there was no getting started

    Is there anyone who can get close
    Is there anything that can help us

I see you standing through the pain
So far so far away
Tears on a torn face
A scream without a sound
And we cry out without a sound
As if with the head under water
Gasping for breath

And the silent procession stops
And stands and stands
Burnt flowers
In a powerless gesture
And as always a hypocritical head
That some words vomit
In the name of the people

Passers-by
A terrace in the fall

Passers-by
The old hotel

One man alone
One man alone

Time to go home
Beauty around the corner
Around the corner

Passers-by
Rarely seen such beautiful colors



Passers-by
As here on these fields
From red to yellow
To dark green

Time to go home
Beauty around the corner
Around the corner

Appeared in the sky
Gone with the moon
In the white winter light

Then free from sin
And signs of remorse <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes on those evenings
After a dark day
I lock myself up
And listen to you

I heard your voice
As a child who could not sleep
And had no idea
What you sang about

I drink up then
Now that I hear your voice again
I drink to you
Twenty years later
Twenty years older

And the Kennedys became
murdered
And Martin Luther King
And every night
The hell of Vietnam
And Johnson was one
killer
And Nixon and Watergate
And Crosby, Stills,
Nash and Young
And love and peace and
LSD

I was so young
Everything was so clear oh
I was so young
It is twenty years later
Twenty years older

Everything turned out differently
Than expected
Although the earth
Still spins on its axis



But there is a difference
What is going on
Do you know what it is?
Robert Zimmerman?

Zimmerman where are you now

Sometimes on those evenings
After a dark day
I lock myself up
And listen to you

I heard your voice
As a child who could not sleep
And had no idea
What you sang about

I drink to you
Now that I hear your voice again
I drink up then
Twenty years later

At the end of the century

(Frank Boeijen and Khadja Nin)

It has been quiet for so long
My head was crowded
This house has been empty for so long
The ideas were gone
But why do you always have to
Being so busy
Why do you always have to
Being a refugee

A ship on the horizon
Keeps coming closer
Who knows what it will bring
Maybe she's in there

But why all those questions
So after sunset
Try to get some sleep
There is a dream waiting for you
I was on the run
For my thoughts
On the run from my feeling
Fleeing from my desire
A traveler with no purpose
Voyageur sans histoire
Voyageur sans histoire
Voyageur sans histoire



But why all those questions
So after sunset
Try to get some sleep
There is a dream waiting for you
I was on the run
For my thoughts
On the run from my feeling
Fleeing from my desire

Voyageur sans histoire
Tu rejoins ton histoire

Voyageur sans histoire
Tu lis dans les memoirs

Voyageur sans histoire
Ton ciel n'est jamais noir

Voyageur sans histoire <|endoftext|> 
Tell me what have you done to me
How come I have everything but no sleep
I am not your friend
Not even your slave

Only a shadow
On your shower curtain
You don't know we're together
And slowly
You move, foam
About your body
Give it, give it, give it to me



When did this madness strike?
How long do I have to do this
I am not your friend
Not even your slave

Only a shadow
In your bedroom
You feel something behind the curtain
And slowly
You turn my eyes
About your body
Give it, give it, give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me-ij-ij
Ah

Give it to me
Hm hm hm hm hm hm
Ah ah ah
Ohooho
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me-ij-ij <|endoftext|> 
Watch out
Traffic drives the other way around
Sings the singer on the corner
For us
On the way to the Criterion

Where the gold shines
And where the last
Fashion shows off
London is proud

At Piccadilly Circus
Disappointing at night
But Piccadilly Circus
Did expect this

Everything
Looks different here than it is
Politeness is limited
And chilly
Only here is what I am missing



I miss the chaos
And which I had had enough of
I miss that
Small ugly flat land

Piccadilly Circus
Shines in the night
Has Piccadilly Circus
Waited for me

Excuse me I'm sorry
Unknown in a foreign country

Has Piccadilly Circus
Waited for me <|endoftext|> 
It's eleven o'clock I change
The mirror looks at me
I wonder where will this go
The city is buzzing, the city smells
To go up slowly or to let go
I am familiar with this street
Every step on this sidewalk

Travel to the end of the night
Don't ask where this is going
Travel to the end of the night
Don't ask where this is going

It's two o'clock at the bar
The woman is talking, the woman is smiling
Anyone here for pleasure
Or hunting in the city while traveling at night
I wish I had your eyes
I would see the world differently
I might be drunk



Travel to the end of the night
Don't ask where this is going
Travel to the end of the night
Shall we then together ... together

Give me your hand, give me your mouth
Makes me feel like this has always existed
Don't feel inhibited, let go
At five o'clock the birds are singing
That it becomes light without sleep
That everything turns into a .....

Travel to the end of the night
Don't ask where this is going
Travel to the end of the night
Shall we go down together? <|endoftext|> 
Now that everything will be done soon
And the roads have been cleared
For the journey to freedom
Then a new idea emerges
A torrent of thoughts

Slowly on the way to the goal
Whatever that may be
because there it will be
That is the expectation
No life without expectation

You stay forever
You stay forever

Then I just travel in my head
And read some old poems
Where it is good to be
Relaxing is



I have so much
I actually have everything
But you have to see it
You have to feel it

You stay forever
You stay forever

No our days
Never died in beauty
It was the surrender
The grace of friendship
Or find another word
Another sign

You stay forever
You stay forever <|endoftext|> 
If I ask
How are you
How do you answer

How is life
Do you ever come
In the city

Last night I thought
Suddenly to you
You said goodbye again
From a woman

With pain in your heart

If I ask
What are your dreams
What do you answer then

How is life
Are you still dancing?
On the edge



I'm drinking here tonight
But on you
And I want you to remember
That there is more than a woman

It just hurts in your heart
It just gets out of hand
Pain in your heart

Hey you know that
almost all of our friends
are married

Life has meaning
Luck can not end
In a young family

Do you still have
The North Star as a guide
And do you also think that happiness
So far away

Happiness hurts in your heart
It slips through your hand
Pain in your heart
You know about that

You know about that <|endoftext|> 
When you think of hunger or war
When you think about your sick friend
And all that for no reason
Can go wrong just like that

And when you think of unemployment
At the end of the West
Then remember that, a long time ago
Everything was different

Because we come, we come out
(Paapapapaa) from it
(Paapapapaa) yeah we're coming out of it
(Paapapapaa) paradise



And when you think about inequality
To any stranger unwanted by his skin
To that unbelievable stupidity
Who sometimes shows his face

And when you think of swastikas
And unnecessary violence
Then remember that, a long time ago
Everything was different

Let's go back
Go back to it, go back to it
(Paapapapaa) To it
(Paapapapaa) Yes to it
(Paapapapaa) Paradise
Let's go back to it
(Paapapapaa) To it
(Paapapapaa) Yes to it
(Paapapapaa) Paradise

How can we live so poor in spirit
Now make the choice and we will go back
To what has once been
Let's go,
Let's go,
Let's go,
Let's go to it
(Paapapapaa, paapapapaa, paapapapaa) Paradise
Let's go back to it
(Paapapapaa) To it
(Paapapapaa) Back to it
(Paapapapaa) Pa pa pa pa paradise paradise
(Paapapapaa, paapapapaa, paapapapaa) Paradise
(Paapapapaa, paapapapaa, paapapapaa) Paradise <|endoftext|> 
I've been an idiot
Walked around with a blindfold
Everyone knew
Everyone saw it except me
My mind was under the influence
From snake venom

I've been lost
Was on the trail of the lie
Hit my head
Against the wall of the labyrinth
Continued to behave
Like an abandoned child

Open the gates
Now that I'm here again
And ask you to come along
Open the gates
Now that I'm here again
A free existence awaits within it
Open the gates



Time and again I have sinned
Against any commandment or law
And now I know what hell can look like
At the end of that dead end
The message is clear as glass
The prisoner becomes president
The first will ever be the last
If you believe
Dream eventually becomes reality

Open the gates
Now that I'm here again
And ask you to come along
Open the gates
Now that I'm here again
A free existence awaits within it
Open the gates

Open the gates
Now that I'm here again
And ask you to come along
Open the gates
Now that I'm here again
A free existence awaits within it
Open the gates
Now that I'm here again
Now that I'm here again
Now that I'm here again
Open the gates
Open the gates <|endoftext|> 
I was a man
Which came from nowhere
Had no reason either
To go home
Because I was already home

All over the place
All over the place

But now it is different
Wherever you are
You close the door behind you
To go back later
The house is waiting for you

All over the place
All over the place



Is it so that you are waiting for me?
Wait until I come out
I was tall
All over the place
All over the place
All over the place

Or had I really disappeared
In your eyes
Out of sight
It was so
All those nights all this time

All over the place
All over the place
All over the place
All over the place

I was the man
Which came from nowhere <|endoftext|> 
I can hear your voice while you are away
Maybe I can ask the Gods
To make you return
Would they allow me to

I make the trees and the stones weep
Deform the stars by my complaining
Sing to Heaven
Nobody can be insensitive to this

The God Herald will accompany me
On my journey into the depths to you
I'll try not to look back
Because then I lose you



Until we're upstairs and back
Out of the dark realm
Will you see me then?
Do you remember who I am

Uncertain
Soft
Without impatience

Farewell is a change that lasts
Farewell is a start
The beginning of time
The time of goodbye

Uncertain <|endoftext|> 
Everywhere, something was left of me
Recently another book, in the north in a city.
Recently a hat, in a taxi at night.
Everywhere, something was left behind from me.

Everywhere I once forgot something
Recently another name, of someone I have seen for a long time.
Last farewell, suddenly lost

Everywhere, something was left behind from me.



And everywhere there was something left of me.
Maybe a song, in the heart of you.
Maybe nothing, nothing is perfect

Everywhere, something was left of me

Maybe nothing, nothing is perfect.
Everywhere, something was left of me
Everywhere, something was left of me <|endoftext|> 
The politician says
That his message is not getting across
Did you get it?
We've got it
The commissioner says
That he didn't understand me
But do you see it
We've got it

Because where there is power
Is abuse of power
Where there is smoke
Is fire
And even a child
Notices that

Now the world
Is confused
And none
System is
Where you with good decency
Believe in



What is the president hiding
Under that smile
Did you get it?
We've got it
The government always has it
About the national interest
But we get them
We've got them

Because where there is power
Is abuse of power
Where there is smoke
Is fire
Even a child
Notices that

Now the world
Is confused
And none
system is
Where you with good decency
Believe in

One day nothing matters anymore
One day you lose so much
That doesn't matter anymore
One day
A beautiful landscape is enough

Or an innocent face
Seen somewhere in passing
On those days without a memory
Those days that just disappear

One day
Do you
You always matter



Your face is a beautiful landscape
Your landscape is a beautiful sight
Your embrace is a poem
One day
Everything seems lost

One day
Do you
You always matter <|endoftext|> 
The light shines in your eyes
And your mouth is talking dear
words
And your lips look soft
Created to be kissed
to become
Thoughts play in your head
Where no one
Nobody knows anything about it

The secrets you keep
Out of a dark and deep
past
Are on your face
written
Beauty full of pain
Maybe I will
wounds can help
Step-by-step
Time disappears



refr .:
    But we are unperturbed
    We never get old
    Then we still are
    Seeking
    The secret of husband and wife

Your skin feels like velvet
Two bodies become one
In a dark room
On a cold winter night
And the time that is stolen
Slowly
It is slowly getting daylight

Through the snow the rain
Through the wind
And through the fire the water
Through the storm
I'll be looking

Through the desert to the sea
By the river
And through the valley along the abyss
About the mountain
I'll be looking



Through the anger through the admiration
Because of the success, the failure
Because of the shame
I'll be looking

Because of the loss the grief
The victory
Through the dark to the light
To the end
I'll be looking

Through the crowd through the loneliness
Because of the feeling I own
I will not lose it
I'll be looking <|endoftext|> 
Somewhere along the highway
Where no one goes
They are waving
Where no one stops

Somewhere in Germany
In a city that no one knew
Until it got on TV
Is a burnt-out house

Somewhere in the Netherlands
Somewhere in the south
Behind bars
A man died in the basement



He wasn't from here
Not from here
Not from here
Not from here

Through all times
Here in this country
Have we come
And sought our salvation

We weren't from here
Not from here
Not from here
Not from here
Not from here
Not from here
We weren't from here
Not from here <|endoftext|> 
I think about that time of ideals
At that time when everything was possible
When the world was still divided
In east and west
It was so clear who was good
And so clear who is bad
But now the truth is coming to light
There is no right or wrong

Then I know what it is
Then it dawns on me
It's not the world
But I who lost innocence
When when did that moment come
When did that take place
When am I on my way

I believed in truth
I believed in heroism
I believed in friendship
And thought fairness existed
But of course I was living in dreams
I wish I could still do that
Sometimes for a moment when I look at you
I see it once existed



Then I know what it is
Then it dawns on me
It's not the others
But I who lost innocence
When when did that moment come
When did that take place
When am I on my way
lost innocence

Was it the failure
After a success
Or the betrayal of a good friend
Were they the nights of insomnia
After the day you left me
It was fleeing into recklessness
And in everything that is forbidden
No, it was the sight on that morning
In the mirror, my face

Then then I knew what it was
Then it hit me
That I over the years
Been so innocent
As long as I turned out to be a child
And it still comes back often
But in general
Innocence loses patience
Then then at that time
There was no going back
Because over the years
Turns innocence into guilt
Because over the years
Turns innocence into guilt <|endoftext|> 
Nijmegen is in the distance
At sunset
The bridge the church tower
I'm going home
It's a long time ago
So long ago

My old white house
On the hill
Once was there
Dinner for two
It's a long time ago
So long ago

Here I was too rich
And all alone
Like God in France
Have I lived here

Silvia, Silvia, my first love
In the snow
With father on the back
Hey beautiful
It's a long time ago
So long ago



Like God in France
Have I lived here
Here I was too rich
And all alone

I know I left one day
Not afraid of the future
But I fear goodbye
From so long ago
So long ago

Dig in the swamp
Digging into memory
Dig under a rock
Digging for what has been

In the Holy Spirit

My eyes hurt
They have seen so much
When everyone is asleep
I hold my heart

Is this the limit
How far can love go
Is this the edge
from the abyss

I can visit
Is there someone waiting for me?
I suggest going to town
to go
Until the last hour of
the night

Looking for new blood
Looking for a new mind
Give me that feeling again
I've been without it for so long
Give me new eyes
A new face, a new one
mouth
Without a past on the way to
the future



A friend became an enemy
Gave a kiss of betrayal
And this drunk
Speaks the truth

Beauty is sweeter
Than revenge can ever be
The lights come on
It's time

I had more to offer
Then a night of false alarms
Now that I walk home
With a drunken soul underneath
my arm

Give me new blood
Give me a new mind
Give me that feeling again
I've been without it for so long
Give me new courage
To get through this madness
to go
A wild and romantic book
From which I never take you again
let go <|endoftext|> 
You live in my dreams
You never leave me alone
Don't let go of me
Never leave me alone

You know my secrets
Everything I think
Everything I do
Everything I feel

But the walls are empty
And I had already said goodbye
Before you were gone
And here in the house it is quiet
And my friends are scared
That I fall off the tightrope
On which I dance



Not that I'm lost
No, not that I'm lost
But I hear your voice
During the night

But the walls are empty
And I had already said goodbye
Before you were gone
And here in the house it is quiet
And my friends are scared
That I fall off the tightrope
On which I dance

Not that I'm lost
No, not that I'm lost
But I hear your voice
During the night

You don't leave me alone
You won't leave me alone
You don't leave me alone
You won't let go of me
Because I hear your voice
Because I hear your voice
During the night <|endoftext|> 
He is not a hero
At least not one that counts
But he tries his best to stop
Let him go
It does color well with the wallpaper
He can handle a little bit of the world

I don't know where he lives
But sometimes he sits next to me
Suddenly he is sitting outside on the stairs next to me
Only ten and no friends
And bullied very often
But he won't admit that, he's giving you a joke

When I get into the schoolyard, man
Everyone has to laugh (2x)

Then he sits next to me, then he talks for hours
He looks like me the way I was
Then I want to help, say look at me
I was never the best in class either



But then he says: And now then?
What do you make of it now?
I saw you on TV yesterday
You didn't seem to understand
But the louder your jokes
And that doesn't really make you much happier

When I get into the schoolyard, man
Everyone has to laugh (2x)

Sometimes someone says
Saw you again yesterday
Wondered what you were doing
I'm just saying talk to a guy a little bit
Who knows it all
Talk to yourself as it is called

I am not a hero
At least not one that counts
But I'm doing my best to stay put
What I'm shouting doesn't seem bad
But what I write I really am
That way I can handle a bit of the world

When I get into the schoolyard, man
Everyone has to laugh (2x) <|endoftext|> 
The chess players in East and West
Are on the move with their weapons
And the people resist
It is not heard

The singer gives his opinion
About the actions of the state
He falls short nonviolently
His conscience not locked yet

Nobody is right
Nobody is at peace
Will there ever be no war
Between East and West
Or just between you and me

In South America you disappear without a trace
There is no hope in the East block
And the people resist
It is nipped in the bud



History believes in facts
But if you read between the lines carefully
You taste the blood of people
Like you and me

Nobody is right
Nobody is at peace
Will there ever be no war
Between East and West
Or just between you and me
Between you and me

Nobody is right
Nobody is at peace
Will there ever be no war
Between East and West
Or just between you and me

Nobody is right
Nobody is at peace
Will there ever be no war
Between East and West
Or just between you and me

The chess players in East and West
Nobody is right
Nobody is right <|endoftext|> 
The Theater of Man, without any doubt ... doubt.
Apparently, probably the viewer's fate.
You do not participate in the whole of the gears.
Let them go, let it go.



And the sea goes on, and the clouds pass. And the woman walks by, you haven't seen her, you haven't seen her. And god draws lines in the sky, in the sky good people cheap everyone you are nowhere alone anymore. That's a good thing

And god draws stripes, in the sky in the sky good people cheap everyone you are nowhere anymore, only that is a good thing. <|endoftext|> 
I ask from you
A hug
I ask from you
A sign on the wall
I ask from you
A reconciliation
And maybe yes
A helping hand

We say goodbye
From this city
And we disappear
During the night

Oh dear I will
Not just home
Not just home
Not just home
I want from you
No obligation
No lifebuoy
For a drowning person

Not fake romance
But more one
Song that itself
Naturally sings

We say goodbye
From this city
And we disappear
During the night



Oh dear I will
Not just home
Not just home
Not just home

I want
Not just home
Not just home
Not just home

But go much further
Than where you've ever been
Go much further
Than where you've ever been

I want
Not just home

But go much further <|endoftext|> 
The bed was only half slept at night, she took half of my books.
Half of my salary is more than enough, I now sleep for two.
The plates were all mine. I turn them as hard as I can. Television was allowed
love them, like I can't live without them.
What an existence, what a bug's life. It can't be broken, what luck.
Red wine, red wine. Come let us be merry.

I drink my stroke every night, I haven't had food for weeks.
I pee in the sink just like I used to, I sleep with my clothes on.
What an existence, what a bug's life. It can't be broken, what a luck.
Red wine, red wine. Come on, let us be merry.



I am no longer used to silence, especially not for long.
The freedom I wanted back actually scares me.
Hmm ..
Yet it is not that I miss her, it is unusual for a while.
No one, no one was mistaken. It takes getting used to my own life.

A kitchen full of dirty glasses, things can only get better.
Who needs furniture or curtains? I'll start from the beginning.
What an existence, what a bug's life. It can't be broken, what a luck.
Red wine, red wine. Come on, let us be merry.
Red wine. Come let us be merry .. <|endoftext|> 
Look for me around you when you feel like you miss me
I know what my departure has done
I'll come when you want
Just think my dad is the wind
I am so light now
I always find your face

Look for me around you when you are angry or sad
Or want to tell about what you have experienced
I'll come when you want
I'm your father after all, the wind
And it doesn't differ much from how fast I've lived

When the roof tiles are blowing
When the grass grows at your feet
When the wind caresses your cheeks
Here I am!

When the sea sings to you with foam
When the crying sounds past houses
When the wind forces you forward
Here I am!



Run Lenny run
If you miss me run very fast with me
Run Lenny run
And if you are angry, you don't feel like it
Then run into me anyway
Run Lenny run

Look for me in the trees
See the tops swinging
I am your father the wind, I'm coming!
Look for me in the harbors
And when the boats slowly dance
Your father, the wind is coming!

When the grain waves in the fields
When the sand drifts over dunes
If the wind even shifts your bike
Here I am!

When the hair blows before your eyes
When your jacket turns around your body
When the wind caresses your cheeks
Know that I miss you!

Run Lenny run
If you miss me run very fast with me
Run Lenny run
And if you are angry, you don't feel like it
Run anyway, but hard against me
Run Lenny run n n n <|endoftext|> 
I am suddenly awake
And just as always
My pants, my shirt, my keys and gone
I pull up, I leave behind
I am fun for one night and
I know, don't need to say that again

And now the sun is rising, the sun is rising
And I'm driving straight for it
Asphalt for me alone
The king too rich
Everything about me where I look
With that feeling that cannot be driven away
I actually wanted to stay longer

I turn on the radio
Turn the window down
It's cool, it's not yet half past five
It always starts in the pub
And it always ends early in the morning
Me alone, in my old DS



And now the sun is rising, the sun is rising
And I'm driving straight for it
Asphalt for me alone
The king too rich
Everything about me where I look
With that feeling that cannot be driven away
I actually wanted to stay longer

It is now six in the morning
I have the sun in my back
I'm driving back to your house
My head in the wind
But curious what I think
Maybe at home somewhere at last

And now the sun is rising, the sun is rising
And I drive right in it
Asphalt for me alone <|endoftext|> 
I have paid my debts
All my ships burned
I made it to the finish line
Where the rest are stranded
I have changed my course
I open the hunt
I've set my mind
On what I've never had

Get those glasses again
Fill them up again
And we drink late into the night
Nothing can stop me anymore
Nothing can stop me anymore
Now that I consider everything I had to let go
Nothing will stop me anymore

I did not escape the fight
Had all the blows
I've taken the truth
Every lie debunked
My desire bundled
To a light in the night
Along the ways of love
Along the way of my heart



Get those glasses again
Fill them up again
We drink late into the night
Nothing can stop me anymore
Nothing can stop me anymore
Now that I consider everything I had to let go
Nothing will stop me anymore

Maybe I'll lose everything
What has been dear to me
But I was on the sidelines for too long
I've been gone too long
I have to take this chance
I've waited a long time for it
Will it be winning or losing
at the end of the day
Will it be winning or losing
at the end of the day

Get those glasses again
Fill them up again
We drink late into the night
Nothing can stop me anymore
Nothing can stop me anymore
Now that I consider everything I had to let go
Nothing will stop me anymore <|endoftext|> 
I see two people on the beach
Close to the water, hand in hand
The sun is setting, they are silent with happiness
I just met her because that's you
She smiles at him, he looks like me
But that is not possible, because I destroy everything
I can never be that boy
That rest, that love, nothing for me
But why does it seem so familiar?
I love you, as you can see
But something isn't right here
I'm wearing a ring but I never married you

I am not myself
Or never been in all those years
I'm the pacemaker at the wrong party
I have never or never been myself
I have never or never been myself

I see two people, they stand up
She turns, we have to go
Look into my eyes and see the same pain
Two people connected before
All that love, what a sin
We are both but don't want to be

I am not myself
Or never been in all those years
I am the shoemaker on the wrong side
I have never or never been myself
I have never or never been myself



Oh let it be the sun (let it be the sun)
Oh, let it be the beach
Let it be the sea
Let me do something now
Which makes you never want to see me again
Oh let it be the salt (let it be the salt)
Let it be my worst mistake
But never let me forget this
Never forget again
never let me forget this, besides

I have not been myself or have never been in all these years
I have not been myself or have never been in all these years
I have never or never been myself
I have never or never been myself
I have not or never been myself (I have not been myself or never in all these years)
I ain't never been myself either (I haven't been myself or never been all these years) <|endoftext|> 
But sweet, sometimes the image suddenly comes to mind
how you turned under me, how you said with all your body
that it was mine "you mine" is what it said
how I was always short of eyes, hands, lips
To do what I made up

and how I sometimes chose then but you
and how I heard that I won everything



Night music
Night music

That you would sleep naked as if you were just thrown there
Tired but so happy
and how I felt that you had given me the best
I really want to be with you
addicted to that trust
that sweet child who, inside, for once called not to stop
I've seen the whole woman really, got to see, over and over
I've seen the sky turn red, red with love
thank you very much, thank you very much

Night music
Night music
Night music <|endoftext|> 
Hey, sir, what's the weather like?
And how is your garden?
And the kids, are you all right?
And your wife is already turning brown?
And your mother still at the time?
Already booked the holiday?
What are you doing behind the Central?
Is it death that you are looking for?

Because no one dies of love
But indifference
Or pride or stupid mistakes
Or just ignorance
No one dies of love
What keeps me going ?!
No one dies of love
But everything around it

Hey, student, nice guy
Is the study still going well?
And go out tonight? Because your cock is on fire



Fresh lady without plastic
Because that is too much hassle
Lie down nice time bomb
You must be tired of life

Because no one dies of love
But indifference
Or pride or stupid mistakes
Or just ignorance
No one dies of love
What keeps me going ?!
No one dies of love
But everything around it

It's a big disease, little name
It kicks everyone aside
Just keep pointing with your finger
Because then you can queue

Right behind me <|endoftext|> 
She hears him coming up the stairs
How he speaks softly to himself
Takes his keys out of his pocket
And drop them three times
She hears the key in the lock
The door that was already open
She knows his shoes in his hand
She hears his shoes on the floor

He won't say where he was
She won't bring it up
She's so strong on the outside
But so tired inside
She will be gone by tomorrow
Because she's had it
That's how it has been for years now
She's not even sure anymore
Whether they were ever happy
But she's gone tomorrow
She will be gone by tomorrow

She can see it through her eyelashes
He turned on one light
Now he can't get his blouse off
Because he still has his coat on



And she smells him when he lies next to her
With open eyes on his back
He mumbles good night
She sighs back something unintelligible

He won't say where he was
She won't bring it up
She's so strong on the outside
But so tired inside
She will be gone by tomorrow
She will be gone by tomorrow

Lying like this for so many nights
Left him so many times
Met so many others
and not done so often
But she's gone tomorrow

She will be gone by tomorrow
She's gone she's had it
She's been hiding it long enough
He will not make it long alone
Then someone else will take care of him
But she's gone tomorrow, she's gone tomorrow
And otherwise the day after tomorrow <|endoftext|> 
There you are
In the evening twenty past eleven
On a beach
Eliminate cigarettes
Just the space,
That was all you wanted
Just alone
Because you had so much to process
And take a look
There is the great thinker
Working
On the border of land and sea
The eighth day
So four days to go
While the suffering was ago on day two

Home
Home
I want to go home
Home

It seemed so beautiful
Just some time for yourself
But you don't have that much to tell yourself
So you just get up
And drags you to the beach
Until the moment comes when you can finally call
But not today
That is only allowed tomorrow
And that's actually because of what she said yesterday
She said, 'Dear, if you have nothing to say
Then you don't have to call, I think '



Home
Home
I want to go home
Home

You think: Come on,
Enough to worry about nothing
Stop crying at the moon
Another fifteen minutes
Then it will have been twelve o'clock
So theoretically only three days to go

Then you can go home
Home
You can go home
Home
I want to go home
Home
I want to go home
Home <|endoftext|> 
It's been going like this for hours
Without thinking, without a goal
The words, the sentences
They do not come from within
How long can it take
For anyone can say
What he means
If there is nothing inside
And you can't speak words
Make up more

Because everything has already been said
Every word has been explained
And everything you heard from me
Were all my beautiful words



Let me sleep now
Because that's how it goes better
I was promised
There is nothing more to say
Only dreams in my head

Too long has been whispered
To empty words
Too long ago when you still heard
That I said nice things
But all that beauty is over now

Because everything has already been said
Every word has been explained
And everything you heard from me
Were all my beautiful words <|endoftext|> 
Tonight
When I'm alone
Don't know what to do anymore
Then I drink a lot then it gets late
Then I want you to stand in front of me
I'm telling you it's not going anymore
And then you give me a kiss
And then I sing
A beautiful song
Nice song
Nice song for you

I smoke
My last cigarette gone
And then I have to go to bed
To get up again after an hour
To go outside again
That I did this to us
I hope you get by
And then I sing



A beautiful song
Nice song
Nice song for you

Tonight
When I'm alone
When I cry for you
Then I drink a lot of blur things
Unable to control me
I just want to sing my pain
And that's why I sing now

A nice song for you <|endoftext|> 
And she said well I'm going (well I'm going)
I watched her unsuspectingly
my money, she, or my school or with her
she had worked i had partied (i had parted)
otherwise I would have been with her
that day, that bend now nine years ago
and that thought still occurs to me
the question that accuses me creeps through my head
imagine you were just with her
on vacation together
she was ...
what would have happened
maybe nothing

It's so weird, just check it out
It was my dream: America
I asked her do you come along
she said yes right away
I worked, I had the money
but told me in the pub at night
that day, she now made that turn alone

and that thought still occurs to me
the question that accuses me creeps through my head
imagine you were just with her
on vacation together
was there ...
what would have happened

(maybe nothing)



maybe nothing
because I was still in bed
maybe nothing
because I was driving that day
maybe nothing
because I was still taking a shower
maybe nothing,
maybe the same who knows

I've been checking it for years
I even stood there
but I had no business there
I had to say something.
I stood there for hours in that bend
I've searched 1000 answers
but life is just coincidence

and that thought still occurs to me
the question that accuses me creeps through my head
imagine you were just with her
on vacation together
what was there then
what would have happened

maybe nothing
maybe nothing
because I wanted to have breakfast
maybe nothing
because I wasn't dressed yet
maybe nothing
I couldn't find car keys
maybe nothing,
maybe the same or
nothing, maybe the same

I've been singing for so long
How sad I would be
Revealed with my fear
And just look for the pain
To be able to sing the blues
Did I pretend to be worse
And now that things are really not going so well
Doesn't appear that much
I dreamed of those nights
Strolling lonely on the street
A sad smile from a movie star
I didn't know what to do with my soul
But now also my third best friend
Let me alone on the street
And I really have no idea
Where I did something wrong

Now I miss you
Like I always wanted to miss you
Where I like those masterful sentences
Would write about
Now I miss you

A joke is fun
If you don't expect it at all
You can have misery
If you actually laugh about it
Sadness is bearable
If you invented it yourself first
The blues is really great
The blues is really great
The blues is really great
When someone is waiting for you



Now I miss you
Like I always wanted to miss you
Where I like those masterful sentences
Would write about
Now I miss you

Of course I knew it
Would ever go wrong
But then I already saw myself
Red wine and full moon
A pen in one hand
And in the other a glass
And then sit down very nicely
How sad it was

Now I miss you
Like I always wanted to miss you
Where I like those masterful sentences
Would write about
Now I miss you
Like I always wanted to miss you
What I would compose minor melodies about
Now I miss you <|endoftext|> 
I didn't come here for you
I didn't come here for you
Even though I love to see you
Why I Came Today?
Came to see if I needed to be here sometimes

I once left here
I once left here
With the fire in my stride
Thought there was nothing left
But my heart must still be here somewhere

I miss me, I miss me
Where I am, on my way
I miss me
Where I stay or leave
Nowhere at home, in my place
Either before or completely over
Wherever I am I miss myself

Always took you
Always with me
Even though I didn't know
Thought what I left behind
Was just my fear of not being a real bum



I miss me, I miss me
Where I am on the way
I miss me
Where I stay or leave
Nowhere at home in my place
Either before or completely over
Wherever I am I miss myself

Oh, this village hangs on me like a song
Can it sing or not
To sing or not
That's false hope when I said
It's not a song of mine

I miss me, I miss me
Either before or completely over
I miss me
Never once at home in my place
Either before or completely over
Wherever I am I miss myself

Why I Came Today
I miss myself or what I left behind here <|endoftext|> 
Walking along the water
Dreaming of the sea
Before you know it it will be later
So come now
Along with me
Come along

Procrastination became an end in itself
Waiting elevated to art
Your eyes are way too long for the light
Stayed closed
And for life
So come along

Then look there!
a new day dawns!
Then look there!
there comes the morning!
Time to get up
To come with me
The sky is breaking
The sky is breaking

So many stories
So often things go wrong
Let us translate happiness
-because we can-
In song
And that this is it





Let us sing that there is hope
Make us laugh at grief
Who is gone and who is dead
Because their song
Their song is not this
Their song is not

Then look,
a new day dawns
Then look,
there comes the morning
Time to get up
To come with me
Watch the day
Watch the day dawn
The sky is breaking
The sky is breaking

A song on what's to come
And not on what was there <|endoftext|> 
I told you sweet
I told you right?
You knew what was coming
Here it is now

At first this was a nice motel
Now it's not worth a b movie yet
At first this was the beautiful full life
Now it is, of all that it was
only betrayal

I told you sweet
I told you right?
You knew what was coming
Lovers and losers
I told you
Here we are

the moment we started sweet
The end was also determined
And if you keep waiting for you a little too long
Then it comes itself, it missed you, you sleep
But it just caught up with me



You thought I was stronger
Bigger than something silly like repentance
But I am a man
We are not like that
I told you so? I didn't say it?
I said so ?! I'm telling you!

I told you sweet
I told you right?
You knew what was coming
Lovers and losers

My heart is not made of stone
A case of pure wood
It was the best I could find
When someone left with the gold
My heart is made of the hardest wood
But it still bends if it has to
But not too far and take it easy
I don't really know what it does yet


This is my heart
My wooden heart
The ladies before you have already made it harder
So be nice
It will not hurt
And stealing doesn't seem worth it


You can let it walk well
Then it doesn't hurt that much
As when I still had the original
The gold, gold but small
This heart, I just bought it
Consciously a second-hand
You don't keep buying gold
Even though you had the chance


This is my heart
My wooden heart
The ladies before you have already made it harder
So be nice
It will not hurt





The advantage of a wooden heart
You are more careful with fire
The splinters are for others
There is no need for a lock and is therefore not expensive at all

My wooden heart
My wooden heart

This is my heart
My wooden heart
The ladies before you have already made it harder
So be nice
It will not hurt
This is my heart <|endoftext|> 
Look out the window
See me standing here in the snow
I've come to laugh at the blunder of the century
Let your husband sleep peacefully
Then we have some time
Stay warm by the window
I just want to say something
Or actually I want to know something.

Have you got everything you wanted now?
Did you wake up with a smile?
Does he often say I love you?
Hold him if you are sometimes scared
Does he know your fear and your sorrow
Just shake your head sweet
No wonder you left me

I'm leaving
I'm going to walk
I'm going to walk until the sun comes up
I'm leaving
Until the sun catches up with me
Walk until the sun comes up
And until it shines.



Just stay inside
It's fine this way
I wanted to see you last time
What we used to dream together, half of us don't remember anymore.
I hope you will be happy
I hope I am not mistaken
I hope I will be happy seeing what I miss so much

Does he hold you sometimes when you're scared ...?
Does he know your fear and your grief ...?
Just shake your head sweet
No wonder you left me
I'm going to walk until the sun comes up
Until the sun catches up with me
Walk until the sun comes up
Until it shines <|endoftext|> 
My client was not there
Perhaps near at most
My client was at a distance
And so has hardly seen anything

My client would like to say graga
He was there, but at the back
You say there is a ditch, ma'am?
Then he has vouched for that

My client does not understand the question
And that he gets angry is not surprising, is it?
He's pretty embarrassed about that
And the judge shows him no respect

I feel free as a bird
Bird-free

My client is shocked
He's hardly done anything, right?
The other puts it in his shoes
My client points him correctly



My client has suffered a lot
It was not personally intended that way
It's his shore-and-ship position
The 'victim' felt that

I feel free as a bird
Bird-free

No bridge, no bridge
I didn't write a bridge for this song
No bridge, no bridge
It clearly seemed that way

Well one more then: it's the truth
I really don't put anything in his mouth
They are your words and therefore
You have a lawsuit on your butt now

I feel free as a bird
Bird-free <|endoftext|> 
The sun that low
Depends on water
The girl who wants the kiss
There is never so much change in a cliché
The boy who knows classics
The correct sentence
The right time
But what do you surprise someone with?

She wants to hear what you feel
Sing about you and me
For a lifetime
Of love
And as you mean it

(Fine)

Dear I will stay with me all your life
Dear I will stay with me all your life
Let's just hope she didn't hear what I said
Dear I stay
Dear I stay
Dear I will stay with me all your life

The sun has already gone
The beach already empty
The boy who weighs his chances
An appropriate phrase that can help him now
The girl who closes her eyes
Her hair is swinging
Her lips pursed
But secretly singing from (come on) is something to come of

(Aahaahaahaah)



This is the game
And the game leads to limited time
Are we still going tonight
Maybe tomorrow
But not eternity

She wants to hear what you feel
Sing about you and me
A love
And as you mean it

She wants to hear what you feel
Sing about you and me
For a lifetime
Of love
And as you mean it

Dear I will stay with me all your life
Dear I will stay with me all your life
Just when I was hoping she didn't hear what I said
She sang with me

(So ​​I sang)

Dear I will stay with me all your life
Dear I will stay with me all your life
Sing it softly and just to me
Dear I stay
Dear I stay
Dear I will stay with me all your life <|endoftext|> 
Look out the window
See me standing here in the snow
I have come to laugh
To the blunder of the century
Let your husband sleep peacefully
Do we have some time
Stay warm by the window
I just want to say something

Or actually I want to know something
Have you got everything you wanted now?
Did you wake up with a smile?
Does he often say, "I love you"?

Does he hold you when you're scared sometimes?
Does he know your fear and your grief?
Just shake your head, dear
No wonder you left me

I'm leaving
I'm going to walk, I'm going to walk until the sun comes up
I'm leaving
Until the sun catches up with me
Walk until the sun comes up
Until it shines



Just stay inside, it's fine
I wanted to see you last time
What we used to dream together
Half of us don't remember

I hope you will be happy
I hope I am not mistaken
I hope I will be happy
Now that I see what I miss so much

Does he hold you sometimes when you're scared?
Does he know your fear and your grief?
Just shake your head, dear
No wonder you left me

I'm going to walk until the sun comes up
Until the sun catches up with me
Walk until the sun comes up
Until it shines <|endoftext|> 
It's ten thirty in the morning here
And Amsterdam is drying up
To later drown in the rain again
The place was quiet
I thought I'd call you
But I feel the courage sink in my shoes now

Sorry about the time difference
I should have known better
But when you are awake it is night again here
I want to tell you so badly
What I couldn't do that day
Say what I'm actually not allowed to

It's because I yesterday
Had to be in our old neighborhood
Wait, someone else is on the line
You can hear it fluently
I suspect who that was
I didn't think you'd be alone now



I would have liked to keep everything it was
And that was all I tried
Of all the roads I could walk with you back then
Actually, like today, I just picked the wrong one


It is too late
I shouldn't have called
Sorry about the time difference
But I have to get back to work
Lunch is about to start here. It's too late
More than a year late
Good to hear you and everything
What I actually wanted to say
After all these years, again empty sentences

I would have liked to keep everything it was
And that was all I tried
Of all the roads I could walk with you back then
I chose, actually as today, actually as today. After all these years the wrong one <|endoftext|> 
You can't say what you said
And then suddenly: "" I didn't say that ",
Or what you cried like: "I didn't mean it that way",
When you say it it's said
And is it certainly heard that way,
And the ugly is felt so ugly hard.


Then you think before you say something
But no, you just throw it out
Do you care dude
"˜T is text, no more,
And I take a breath for an answer
Don't wait, come on, go on
Because that which you just didn't mean
Can still do it again.



(Rather right than luck)
I know what you're saying
I pretend to listen
I pretend to listen
That's something,
And if you ask me
To repeat your last sentences,
Then I will succeed, no problem, please
Get lost.

(Better right than luck)
And when you talk I think what I would say if I wanted to talk
There's so much in my head
You never believed me
You never believed me if I said I'd sing it someday
And I'm singing it now.

(Rather right than luck)
Well, you gotta forget everything I didn't say
I'd rather be right than lucky
And I hope and I know that for you too
Everything you said to me you have lost nicely,
Forget it,
Sweet forget it.

Better luck than right,
(Rather rather) <|endoftext|> 
It's time, we're back
The whole country is ready, side by side
With friends or family
In the pub or on the square
Everyone lives for orange, big and small

It's time we get there
Don't let our lion stand in his shirt
We love orange
And fight on and on
Our patriotic heroes go for it

We shout our lions to the cup
We are a great orange legion
It certainly works with blood, sweat and tears
The Netherlands you are the champion

We shout our lions to the cup
We are a great orange legion
It certainly works with blood, sweat and tears
The Netherlands becomes champion



It's time for red, white and blue
Our boys, they play for you
In villages and towns, all fans come together
The orange fever awakens in everyone

We shout our lions to the cup
We are a great orange legion
It certainly works with blood, sweat and tears
The Netherlands you are the champion

We shout our lions to the cup
We are a great orange legion
It certainly works with blood, sweat and tears

feel the warmth of the sun
on a day that started like this
like all those others
not really special
after reading the newspaper
there seemed to be something wrong
For a moment I didn't know what was happening to me

after all those nights
weeks of waiting
was there the day
on which my fantasy
it came out
could not resist
talk to you
just for a while
I'm not sure
how to tell you
that no one can give
what you every night
does to me again

since I've seen you now
I keep hoping because maybe
you come along more often
fulfills my wishes



watch that setting sun
on a day that started like this

New tomorrow, new life

Verses:
I'm lying in bed and I'm completely flat
Even my shower failed
I don't let the sun in
My cat must be a tiger
Apart from nothing, there is nothing in it today
How I feel I'm not going anywhere

I remember feeling very gloomy
Yesterday's party with a friend
Suddenly you were standing there
Got incredibly close to me immediately
Let go of every inhibition with me
But in the middle of it the film broke with me

Refrein:
New tomorrow - new life
And everything that was yesterday no longer exists for me
New tomorrow - new life
And you are only one who was there yesterday, but nothing more



Verses:
We had a lot of fun
You kept refilling my glass
The lights were already out for me
You went one step further
The last round was on you
But I had been under the table for a long time

Refrein:
New tomorrow - new life
And everything that was yesterday no longer exists for me
New tomorrow - new life
And you are only one who was there yesterday, but nothing more

You will definitely do that to me
I won't tell you that a second time
I've learned that I can also lose very well

Refrein:
New tomorrow - new life
And everything that was yesterday no longer exists for me
New tomorrow - new life
And you are only one who was there yesterday, but nothing more

It was a fine day
I remember seeing you
you were dreaming
quiet in the summer sun
you didn't look up or around
didn't see me coming

I didn't even know your name
but when you saw me standing there
I saw in your eyes
love and early happiness
this couldn't go wrong
I was upside down

You are more beautiful than the stars at night
I never expected anything so beautiful
I can not live without you
you are in all my dreams

Our love will never pass away
because now you stay with me forever
forever the woman I love so much

Almost like in flight
The time goes by
Almost by itself
Almost like in flight
The time goes by
Almost by itself
If you're with me
Almost like in a dream
I say
Almost too much
And yet nothing

Which in the end it is
You are more to me than love
Whatever remains for us in the end you are nothing more than happiness for me
Because everything revolves around me because my life beats faster
You are more to me than love



Are we already there or just beginning?
Are we lost when we win so much
We are almost blind
Am I alone
Where is that going?

Whatever it is in the end, you are more to me than love
Whatever remains for us in the end, you are more to me than happiness
Because everything revolves around me
Because my life beats faster
You are more to me than love

Whatever it is in the end, you are more to me than love
Whatever remains for us in the end, you are more to me than happiness
You are more to me than love
You are more to me than love <|endoftext|> 
My Guitar - Jan Smit

A new morning so the newspaper falls to the mat.
I drink some coffee and I'm on the road again.
I sing for you and anyone who wants to sing along.
I sing to you, a different city every night.

Chorus

With my guitar every day makes sense
The music is in my soul deep inside
No matter what happens, we never break up.
Just me and my guitar

And when the show is over, another hotel awaits, in the darkness and also my companion.

Chorus

Every day makes sense with my guitar.
The music is in my soul deep inside.
No matter what happens, we never break up.
Just me and my guitar.



I sing for you and anyone who wants to sing along.
I sing to you, a different city every night.

Chorus

Every day makes sense with my guitar.
The music is in my soul deep inside.
No matter what happens, we never break up.
Just me and my guitar.

In all the empty hours I'm never alone
I pick up my guitar and play for everyone.

Chorus

With my guitar every day makes sense.
The music is in my soul deep inside.
No matter what happens, we never break up.
Just me and my guitar ... 2x <|endoftext|> 
I sail to Volendam, the village of Volendam,
to the harbor where I can dream away
with the boats that go and come again,
am so happy with my seaside village.

I sail to Volendam, the village of Volendam,
where the eel sound was once born.
Fishing village, I want to belong to you
at your houses, the church and the dike.



Oh my Volendam, my beautiful Volendam,
I see your lights shining from afar
in the night, under a sky full of stars,
with the sound of the wind and the sea.

la la la
la la la
When I'm on the water with my grandpa
he can talk for hours about the sea and the past,
and I love that. <|endoftext|> 
Mattino
Il sole che nasce carezza
pian piano le case sonnachiose
Nell'aria
insieme ad un suon di campane
un profumo di pane e di rose

Ascolta
La rondine innalza il suo canto
nel cieto di questo mattino
che ha gli occhi blu di un bambino
al mattino



When I see you I sing "mi amore",
because without you
I feel so lost.
There in the fragrance that the roses give,
I feel at home, I want
live forever.

When I see you I sing "mi amore",
like a nightingale plays its song.
There in the scent of those red roses give,
I feel at home, I want
live forever. <|endoftext|> 
When I run through your hair, look into your faithful eyes
then I feel happy because I love you so much.

I'm alone, so alone, without you around me
you around me cause you are my best friend.

I saw you cry with grief when I found you
I took you home dear dog,
now we're always together, the two of us, you and me
two, you and me, because you are my best friend.



Stay with me, stay with me, oh my doggy stay with me,
doggy stay with mee, cause you are my dearest friend.

Stay with me, stay with me, oh my doggy stay with me,
doggy stay with mee, cause you are my dearest friend.

I saw you cry with grief when I found you
I took you home sweet dog, now we're always together
the two of us, you and me, two, you and me, because you're my best friend
Because you are my best friend. <|endoftext|> 
Even if the sun shines or the rain falls
When I go to sleep she arrives
I've been lying like this so many times
During the night shift of the moon

As soon as my eyes close slowly
Is it time to go to bed?
Then I start to yawn
I want to go to sleep right away
To be with her like that

Mi amor es solo para ti
I think every time I see her
When she smiles in all my dreams
She will always keep coming
Mi amor es solo para ti
I think again when I see her
She is my whole life for me
Every night on cloud 7

When I open my eyes again
Those dreams do not turn out to be deception
She comes into the room
And then I still remember



That look in her deep brown eyes
I'm instantly on fire
I am in all states
Can hardly speak anymore
As long as she's with me

Mi amor es solo para ti
I think every time I see her
When she smiles in all my dreams
She will always keep coming
Mi amor es solo para ti
I think again when I see her
She is my whole life for me
Every night on cloud 7

Oh mi amor, you're for me
My whole life, every night on cloud 7 <|endoftext|> 
One day my dear grandmother told me
that she went on her way tad alone.
for her very last journey, to a very beautiful paradise.
she said sweet boy when I get there you still sing your song to me
because then I don't feel so .. alone

I sing this song for you alone
bring white roses for you ...
ooohhhh sweet grandmother who loves me.
this here so lonely without you !!
I sing this song to you over and over
and dry my tears over and over again.
ooh dear grandma, I love you,
yours ,, yours !!



Staying at grandma's house with all my friends what a wonderful time that was.
we played scarrble and yathzee and my grandmother always joined.
and we sang the most beautiful songs together. that grandmother knew from days gone by.
but her beautiful voice doesn't sound anymore ..

I sing this song for you alone ,, K bring you white roses ..
ooh dear grandma I love ...
this here so lonely without you !!
I sing that song to you over and over
and dry my tears over and over again.
oh dear grandma, I love you .....
of your ,, of you ..

YOURS ,, YOURS !! <|endoftext|> 
A man, a woman, a child and a car
Your own house under the sun
That was how beautiful happiness could be
Before it all started

A nice job, enough money to spare
Yet things went wrong outside the door
You couldn't resist temptation
From then on the nagging started

REFRAIN (2X)
Would you rather be alone?
Without it around you
What makes you happy
Even though it hurts you
Do you want to be clear
For the people by your side
How will it continue
Can you handle this life
Without the none that you love

Your adventure ended in something else
That one time became more and more
But one day it all came true
From then on it was no longer possible



CHORUS
Would you rather be alone?
Without it around you
What makes you happy
Even though it hurts you
Do you want to be clear
For the people by your side
How will it continue
Can you handle this life
Without the none that you love

Would you rather be alone?
What makes you happy
How will it continue
Can you handle this life
Without what you love

Would you rather be alone from now on <|endoftext|> 
Dear grandpa, see tears in your eyes
because you are all alone now
I keep seeing you staring at that picture
You say my boy, like her was only one.

Dear grandpa, those tears in your eyes
hurt me, so dry them quickly now.
I always keep coming to your house
because grandpa, I love you so much

Your silver hair shines in the summer sun
like you sing when I could
I can even see your smile through your tears
I promise you grandpa I'll never leave you alone



Dear grandpa, I see tears in your eyes
because you are all alone now
I keep seeing you staring at that picture
You say my boy, like her was only one.

Dear grandpa, those tears in your eyes
hurt me, so dry them quickly now
I always keep coming to your house
because grandpa, I love you so much

Dear grandpa, I love you so much

The sun is going to disappear
The end of the day
Just look up
To the stars that shine

Will this be forever
Go on forever
Will our love
To exist forever

Without any worries
Are you sitting there so still
Now close your eyes
And don't think about tomorrow

Give me your hands
And dream all night
I'll warm you
Yes I hold you

Loved ... a rose in the morning
Loved ... so tender and soft

See how the moonlight
The shadow dissipates
See how it plays with
Your hair and your eyes

I sit in silence
And whisper your name
Will our love
To exist forever



Loved ... a rose in the morning
Loved ... so tender and soft

See her smiling without feeling, An unattainable goal, Still striving for it.
Smell, the scent of great courage still running through her blood, but why .. ??

Her name is laura, a very sweet girl
When I look into her eyes I get lost for a moment.
Oh laura, a life of sorrow, all her friends are out walking
But this does not apply to laura

Taste the taste of her fight, it is so unfair, but she accepts that
Hear the voices in her head that make her believe again, but why .. ??



Her name is laura, a very sweet girl
When I look into her eyes I get lost for a moment.
Oh laura, a life of sorrow, all her friends are out walking
But this does not apply to laura

But why is everything over now (everything over now)
Never let life set you free again

Sometimes when you're lonely
and knows deep valleys,
let your sorrow go free for a moment
and air your heart to me

then wipe your tears quickly,
think of moments back,
where we laughed together
even if it is tough for a moment,

if it is against you,
your eyes no longer shine,
when sometimes it's empty around you,
then know that we are weathering the storm,
together we can take on the world,
walls built around you,
and everything in me that trusts you



sometimes when you're down
has no way out for a while,
you don't know where to go anymore
will I be there for you

then open your heart,
don't keep you tall for me,
I want to laugh with each other again
even if it is tough for a moment,

if it is against you,
your eyes no longer shine,
when sometimes it's empty around you,
then know that we are weathering the storm,
together we can take on the world,
walls built around you,
and everything in me that trusts you

then know that we are weathering the storm,

no, I haven't understood your words yet
I haven't gathered courage yet.
I'm sure now that I heard you cry
you lie next to me pretending to sleep.
and I know if I want to touch you
fretfully fends off like I'm a stranger.
I'm afraid of your face when we wake up
I'm afraid I won't even know you anymore.
and I can almost see your body next to me in the dark
I know every spot of it.
I may never see you again and it amazes me
that I can now think so calmly and clearly.

I even recognize your way of breathing
in the dark of our hard narrow bed.
and I feel the warmth of your body radiate
even if you put me out in the cold
I remember well the first night we were here
it was winter and you missed the train.
you were in my bed staring in front of you
because you didn't know too much about it yet.
and I wanted to seem very experienced
but I didn't know much more about it than you.
in the morning we did not dare to look at each other,
I regretted it and was still very happy.



it's morning again and the sun has already started shining,
through my eyelashes I see you across the room
in the soft light that shines through the curtains.
and you're ashamed of me now, you get dressed.
I hope I will never experience such a night again
and it doesn't matter if I hold my feelings down
but you gave me something to say goodbye
the feeling of love and happiness.
and I jump out of bed, I open the windows,
people swarm in the square, the sky is blue.
I want to walk without purpose and without roads,
and be happy even if it is not with you.

I want to go to sea to ride the waves,
I want to fly like a bird in the sky
be in the clouds or buried under foam.
It's over and I'm free and with a sigh
with a smile and a tear I am through the streets
from the city where it is now spring.
and I've left winter behind
our love can no longer exist.
But even though I get out of here I keep on singing
I always have a song and my guitar.
I keep dreaming of exactly the same things
I'll see you again and we'll stay together. <|endoftext|> 
Birds that get lost when the wind doesn't come for them
Flying past me unexpectedly in a long line
Saw them come just in time was half dreaming again after a Long Night, aha

Watching football somewhere in a pub
Hadn't been in a long time And when they won it was party time
Once I got home I couldn't see the trees and the forest for the beer anymore, aha

Without slices of bread, I was probably half dead
If I hadn't gotten up right away this morning
Right outside on the bike, although my head doesn't want to do anything for a while
So a new day starts, time to go again

Live while you can talk to Jan en Alleman
Seize the day, be ready, show THAT you exist
Love life, life loves you
go out and say it so everyone hears

A quiet sleep is the best weapon
Already have 2 aspirins against the war in my head
Would it take much longer Were these my last hours on the globe, aha



Without slices of bread, I was probably half dead
If I hadn't gotten up right away this morning
Immediately outside on the bike, although my head doesn't want anything yet.
A new day begins, it's time to go again.

Live while you can talk to Jan en Alleman
Seize the day, be ready, show THAT you exist
Love life, life loves you
go out and say it so everyone hears

Live while you can talk to Jan en Alleman

Live while you can talk to Jan en Alleman
Seize the day, be ready, show THAT you exist
Love life, life loves you
go out and say it so everyone hears <|endoftext|> 
how long will you follow me
like the shadow of my heart
I just got caught in you
until everything is expected
it seemed better then
to release you
still much too young for that
an eternal year

how long will be on my mind
being the past present
can ever blur images
like in an old chorus
I thought our love would wear out
I wanted to get out into the meadow world!

ref.
don't set me free
I just can't forget you
don't set me free
this desire hurts so much
I hear your voice
i feel you in my dreams
come to me



I hear your voice
i feel you in my dreams
come to me

how long do I have to miss you
when will you cross my path again
who are you with and what are you doing
in which metropolis
I admit it is hardly bearable
that you might be there with someone else

When, I left Havana, val game Dios
na di-has seen me leave if it was not me
yuna, cute quachi nanga I'll go here
I know, he came after me-qy yes path

If a dove comes to your window
treats the concarino that is my person

Oh sweetie, yes, oh, give me your love
help me come with me sweetie
where do i live

Oh sweetie, yes, oh, give me your love
help me come with me sweetie

it's that simple to see what love is.
It's exactly the same love that I miss.
In the mirror I do not see that person that you do see.
Get out there, so don't miss me.

Baby I can't take your love anymore.
Where you grew I simply stopped.
Where I used to go for you is now just one reminder.
Just let me go.

Baby I can't take your love anymore.
Where you grew I simply stopped.
I am no longer worthy of you, am not the prince in white horse.
Don't shed a tear, just let me go.



In my mind I see our first kiss.
Hand in hand on the water, so warm and cozy.
I have now lost that feeling, it has made way for regret.
Go on, it's high time.

Baby I can't take your love anymore.
Where you grew I simply stopped.
Where I used to go for you is now just one reminder.
Just let me go.

Baby I can't take your love anymore.
Where you grew I simply stopped.
I am no longer worthy of you, am not the prince in white horse.
Don't shed a tear ...
Just let me go <|endoftext|> 
The city gate closed in the dark,
the tower strikes the last hour.
And red light sparks along the canals
like imitation hellfire.
The night watchman with his blind head
climbs along the bridges stiff and gray.
His call echoes in alleys and doldrums,
the slow long-forgotten wise.

Twelve, one, I keep watch
the clock has struck.
It will be days again soon
and the night is cold.

His soft footstep in the park
that makes twin ghosts flee,
draws dragging through the dark green.
He smiles wisely and bittersweet.
A gray man is on the street
and sings his song of brandy.
When the night watchman passes him,
then he agrees to the chorus.

Twelve, one, I keep watch ...



Then heaven becomes porcelain,
the last red light goes out.
The whistle of the first train,
the night watchman shakes his brown head,
flee the sunlight in a pub
and leaning on his halberd
he drowns there early the day,
a dew of tears in his beard.

He can't live by day
he flies himself to pieces in the sun.
No man ever saw him differently
then like a great gray moth.

Twelve, one, I keep watch ...

I am the night watchman of the Rembrandtplein
but not by Rembrandt van Rijn.
I look in slums and alleys
during storm and rain
whether there are burglars.
And sometimes one gets a little suspicious,
then I turn it over to the 5 times 8.
I am the night watchman at Rembrandtsplein
but not by Rembrandt van Rijn. <|endoftext|> 
I'm in the room of the high mansion
Dusty windows filter the warm rays of the midday sun
Fragments of the carillon come from afar
And I think about the country of origin

I'm leaving my homeland for a while, I'm in the distant land
Where I left my mother
She didn't have time to get to know me
And I too, I don't know her



I am now known as Boudewijn de Groot
My mother knows nothing about it, because my mother is dead
I have a few more photos from India that show her
As a hushed dancer in a long and white robe

Her portrait on the mantelpiece, we look at each other
Her eyes are my eyes, but I look like her too
Sometimes the distant carillon reminds me of the gamelan
To the country where it all began

Dutch East Indies, my mother, I sometimes miss them
But I don't know much about it <|endoftext|> 
Mr. President, good night.
Sleep well in your beautiful white house.
Don't think too much about all those distant shores
where your boys are, lonely, far from home.
Don't think about those forty-six deaths,
that mistake last with that bombing.
And forget the fourth of those Ten Commandments
whom you certainly know as a good Christian.

Don't think about all those young frontline soldiers
dying alone in the distant tropical night.
Let that pale pacifist clique talk
Mr. President, sleep tight.

Just dream of victory and victory
dream of your beautiful ideal of peace
that has never been obtained by bloody murders,
dream that you will succeed this time.
Just don't think about all those people who fuck up
how many women, how many children have been murdered.
Dream that you will be the winner
and do not believe a word of all this opposition.



Bayonets with bloody hilts
keep watch at your command far from here
for the glory and honor of the free west.
Mr. President, sleep tight.

Don't be too alarmed when you are in your dreams
sees all those guiltless victims
who died in the fight over there
and ask you how much longer this should go on.
And you will know so slowly
that there are people who are sick of violence,
who do not forget the blood and the misery
and for whom a human life still counts.

Don't dream too much about all those dead people
dream of victory and power.
Don't think about all those peace wishes.
Mr. President, sleep tight. <|endoftext|> 
When the sun is a circle,
is a circle within a circle of fire,
at that hour
I have people around me.
No I am not alone, no not alone.

Orange red flames
of the roses-roses-roses.
Orange above! Orange above!
From the forest as green as moss.
I have chosen my friends around me.
To love ahahahah,
can you believe in something else
than to be together and to be one,
be alone with each other?

Face in twilight.
People around me.
Singing and soft whispers.
People around me.
Music and empty glasses.
People around me.
The dancing of the fools.
People around me.

And row a boat, play around
and the buttercups bloom,
a sunflower and bear claw,
the sky white gray bright blue.

When there are white stars,
moon and planets are distant and soft,
the night laughs,
then I have people around me.
No I am not alone, no not alone.

Oh nights I was looking for you
in the summer-summer-summer
far from the pond in the forest
and the warm scent of honey everywhere.
In the wind ahahahaha
can i believe in anything else
then always be and be eternal,
forever and everywhere?



With children and animals.
People around me.
Midsummer night pleasures.
People around me.
And lie by the fire.
People around me.
At twenty-five.
People around me.


Love without clothes
and always learn something different.
And dance with the hartband,
a song that no one else knows.

When the sleet
the cloudstamp evaporates to snow
and angel hair,
then I have people around me.
No I am not alone, no not alone.

A group of friends
in the motley round-round-round.
That goes to Den Bosch,
sweet sweet little Gerrit.
Can I warm myself by their fire
but a wall of crystalline scales
will separate us ahahahaha.
If only I had a hammer in the morning
that would break the glass of cold
of silence around me.

People around me.
People around me.
Never alone, never alone.
People around me.
Never alone.
People around me.
Never alone. <|endoftext|> 
The blue of the sky is green with the smoke,
the wind is hot and tastes like rust,
iron filings stain the roads.
Now in the moat the mud stinks and also
the winter garden is red and desolate,
the dry sand crunches loudly for rain.

A storm wind opens every grave
and tears through the past,
tears pages off the trees,
too much has been suffered.

And at other times I forget myself.

With a chimney black as a stone cannon
loaded with synthetic lead
Krupp shot the heavens
and hits the great spot of the sun
which melts and turns gray as death
and sinks into the gutters.



A super nougat neon light,
the gas is knocking in the tubes.
The oxygen tap closes screaming,
the sea is boiling in the locks.

And at other times I forget myself.

The blast furnaces run across the land
with iron mules red and black,
the entry of the insulators.
They burn the cities with sulfur,
the big filthy cauldron bursts
and no one can hear it anymore.

Break the forest down to cellulose,
tear it into atoms.
The sun melts down into the grave
never to die again.

And at other times I forget myself.
In other times I forget myself. <|endoftext|> 
Under the green sky, in the blue sun
The tin harmony orchestra plays in a large rain barrel
There it travels over the hills and through the large forest
The long procession into the mountains of the circus Jeroen Bosch
And we talk and we sing and we all laugh
Because behind the high mountains lies the land of Maas and Waal.

I walk arm in arm with a hangover in front
behind it two rabbits with a funnel on their heads
and then the big cockerel who lays a glass egg
when you shake it, it snows on the Egmond abbey.

I extend my copper hand to a girl
Then 2 Moors come with their drags in hand
Then the fanfare blows in honor of the scissors
Married with the thimble, they love each other.



Under the purple sky, in the brown sun
The wind band still plays in a large rain barrel
There it travels over the hills and through the large forest
The long procession into the mountains of the circus Jeroen Bosch
And we talk and we sing and we all laugh
Because behind the high mountains lies the land of Maas and Waal.

We escaped the King of Spain
He had caught us in his bed and the pantry
We set fire to all churches with brandy
It's cold fire, so it's okay
and it doesn't get in the paper

The suffering is over, the horizon is shining
When the dead are drunk and pierlala disappears
Then we praise the trumpet and also the fat dragon
And eat shortbread at night at Klaas often's party.

Under the golden sky, in the silver sun
The harmony orchestra always plays in a large rain barrel
There it travels over the hills and through the large forest
The procession goes into the mountains of the circus Jeroen Bosch for good
And we talk and we sing and we all laugh
Because behind the high mountains lies the land of Maas and Waal. <|endoftext|> 
He is standing in the snow at the gate of the city
And pisses off the days of December
He whistles his plush calico cat
Because he suffers from mice that make nests in his beard

But the animal always makes it whistle beautifully
't Dier preaches earnestly for the fish
Fallen from a herring cart

He lures the days with his song
The days fly, it stops
Where does he come from Where does he come from
He cherishes the days of red cellophane
Made of glitter and cotton wool and star paper
No man knows his name. No man knows his name

refr .:
Master Prick Legs
Master Prick Legs
People walk past him
He only remains Master Prikkebeen

Lantern plugs pass silently through the night
He plays his hurdy-gurdy in front of their hairy faces
Sleep well, sleep soundly
A paladin with his soldiers continues to listen to him for a moment

Yet his dish remains empty, they laugh
Only a girl stops talking
A skinny girl with pleasure



Why don't you play another song
Your eyes and your mouth are cold
I don't know a chorus
I wear a key of gold on my breasts
The light in my eye is a star that fades
I can't be like that

refr.

She is dancing in the snow and playing the tambourine
While the calico cat very quietly preaches the passion
It smells of bread and hot wine
And in the snowy night at the balls they expect the new year

The last night comes flying
The last blows have fallen
A flare shoots into the sky

And tomorrow they disappear across the country
Tomorrow they will disappear across the country
The new year is wide and green
A flower meadow is empty and green
Never see him again. Never see him again
Who knows what the days Who knows what the days
will do this year will do this year
She is playing with the cat. She is playing with the cat
And he waves his hand And he waves his hand
Goodbye and goodbye
Goodbye and goodbye
Maybe goodbye
Maybe goodbye

refr. <|endoftext|> 
You scour the streets
And follows the thief's trail
With bums and soldiers
Their caps on one ear
You lift your skirts
And smiles at every man
Who dares in the dark
What is not possible during the day

And at night in the pubs here
Is your name circulating
With the blond foamy beer

I know them 1 by 1
The gentlemen of decency
I will never forget them
Like they do to you
How often do you have such a headline
Drunk, stupid and horny
Not pressed to your chest
Your body wet with drool

And at night in the pubs here
Is your name circulating
With the blond foamy beer

refr .:
Silly Babbe bowl
Malle Babbe come here
Nice piece, silly girl, nice animal with pleasure
Malle Babbe is round
Malle Babbe is blonde
A kiss on your mouth Malle Babbe your nice ass



And on Sundays in church
Then there is such a gentleman
Stiff as a wooden board
To look in his sofa with nails in his head
The blackmailer suit on his sinful body
Afraid of the devil and afraid of his wife
Put an economical penny in the bag
That's how he buys his soul back
And his decency

And you have to go back
Standing somewhere in the dark
As it should

But then the day will come
Then they ring the bell
Then you wear white flowers
And ribbons on your skirt
When we're together
Go out of church arm in arm
What will they watch then
I always think about that

Like at night in the pubs here
I hear your name again
With the blond foamy beer

refr. <|endoftext|> 
I hear the children's voices
I hear them on the field.
Their laughter resounds by the river.
And suddenly I have to think
to the days of my youth.
I wasn't here yet.



Come home now my children
it is much too late.
The clock in the tower strikes eleven.
Your spring, your daylight
you waste playing.
And your winter, your night,
as someone other than yourself.

Come home now my children ... <|endoftext|> 
Inside I lie in my bed
with thoughts out there
where gnomes whistle happily,
because they always have fun.

Inside my warm hole
I hear my thoughts run
that have crawled out
and I feel packed.

Full of confusion and fun
for the cold night out there,
clammy hands on the windows
of some animal.

Must be some kind of chimpanzee.
Shall I let him in?
No, for God's sake, let's talk
I'm in a mess.

It is nice here in bed.
I have my most beautiful dreams
let it come tonight now
and turned off the alarm.

But at night at noon
a guy comes from the attic
with a big bag full of shit
and a bottle full of acetic acid.

I'm afraid of that
but luckily my clothes go
then teach each other mores again
and they run down the hall.

And I hear the top hat
complaining gloomy on the coat rack
because only to tease him,
they fill him with candy.



But I feel a bit lonely
and a girl comes to kiss me.
A bit tricky in the meantime
all those butterflies around me.

But now I have my treasure
nice in my warm bed.
Nice animal, what are you watching.
Have you had a kiss yet?

Leiden is still in trouble
but I don't really care
because the moon, that round yellow,
heaven holds anyway.

But unfortunately the right bottle
showing my sweet dreams
gleaming in my glass,
is now empty, a hard lesson.

And that bottle is to my regret
The center of my life.
With the alarm at half past six
I sink through an eternity.

Oh life is a burden
with seven weeks' work
untouched and unknown
lying aimlessly in the closet.

Oh what am I really sorry
nothing but tears is life
and I sigh with Van het Reve:
It's nothing like misery again.

Snoring in my sleep
I lie here until a quarter to eight
to wait for the dawn,
tomorrow I will be face to face again. <|endoftext|> 
He was twelve, had quick limbs,
boy from the garden of Eden.
When he laughed, laughed out loud
all the larks.
With his glare of teeth,
with his marbled hands
he looked like a delicate angel
from a graceful ball masque.
He could sing clearly
and his hair smelled like lilacs.
Oh he was a water prince
the one in his gold lamee suit
had risen from the sea.
She was thirteen, a gazelle,
and her name was Annabelle.
Annabelle called her both
the doe as the deer.
With her bright red cheeks,
with her glittering spangs,
she appeared in her gauze wedding dress
Mostly on a magic fairy.
Blue were her strange eyes,
blue but without compassion.
Oh she was a little mermaid
which just gradually
had risen from the sea.

Together in the dawn
they walked past the corn.
Mild and without disturbing them
the sunlight shone down.
And under the pink rays
he kissed her lips lingering
and he said her wonderful words,
even the grass was listening.
On hearing those words
meekly gave way to the wheat
and it lisped: welcome,
and offered passage for those two
like the Red Sea once.



When, on the bark of dogs, he
was found days later,
the white prince lay violated
in the wheat without a fairy.
With his dead big eyes
he looked up motionlessly and
his blood still rustled slowly
from a gruesome cut.
Nobody could tell more
how much little Annabelle
loved her angel
from the graceful ball masque.
But the sea is still roaring. <|endoftext|> 
Let's make an appointment
when i touch you
can you touch me.
When I watch you
can you look at me.
But if you avoid me
then I would avoid.

Let's not be mistaken
if i miss you
you should miss me.
And if you don't complain
I won't complain either.
If you put up with me
then I will put up with you.

Because I am me and you are you
at least one of us is free.
Fortunately, fate fell on me.
Because I am me and you are you
at least one of us is free.
Fortunately, fate fell on me.



Let's keep this in mind
when I have a cold
then you also have a cold.
And when I'm hungry
then you also have to eat something.
And from all that I know
you should know a little bit.

So let's hope for the best
if I ever run away
can you run away too.
But if I love you
do you have to love me
and if you marry me
I will marry you

Because I am I ...
Because I am I ... <|endoftext|> 
For a land without a fight,
for a sky without clouds,
for a new time
I would like to populate the city
with people without hate or envy.

Do you know that country, my darling,
with its crystal sky?
Sun on wide green fields
and a ball every night,
where we dance.
Do you know that country, my darling,
do you know that country so far from here?

And a life of gold,
without lies, without tears,
you who love me
I would lead through green avenues,
I had built my house of glass.

Do you know that country, my darling?
Happiness and peace forever,
where we can wander together
without time for time,
wander together.
Do you know that country, my darling,
do you know that country so far from here?



For the humming sea,
for a smile without teeth,
for a new idea,
I would have you on both my hands
want to carry with me.

Do you know that country, my darling?
With that evergreen forest,
where the birds always sing
and we sleep on the moss.
Without weapons, without fights,
without sin, without suffering,
ah without hate, without envy.
Do you know that country, my darling,
do you know that country so far from here?

Do you know that country, do you know that country,
o do you know that country so far from here?
Do you know that country, my darling,
do you know that country?
Oh you know that country so far from here?
Do you know that country, my darling,
do you know that country
do you know that country so far from here?

Do you know that country? <|endoftext|> 
I'll tell you something
before we go to sleep.
I was working all day today.
I didn't have time for you today
I've been curt.
But there were so many questions
and looking for an answer
I created problems again.
I've seen so much
that I am now in the dark
can't close my eyes.
But I would tell you something
before we go to sleep.

I'll tell you something
before we go to sleep.
Today I came to nothing
I have done nothing.
I have planned so much
but I don't remember why.
Because if you start to think
and worry about others
others will pass you by.
And I've seen too much
I had my eyes open
and I can't close them anymore.
But I would tell you something
before we go to sleep.



I'll tell you something
before we go to sleep.
I know I've been way too concerned.
Maybe I wanted to forget
that I'm so lonely.

I wanted to tell you that
before we go to sleep:
that I need you. <|endoftext|> 
How strong is the lonely cyclist
that bent over his handlebars
against the wind
makes his way?
How self-assured the football player
that before the eyes of the public
the match wins,
feel like a champion?
How pleased the businessman laughs
without compassion that competitor
finds reports,
almost going bankrupt itself.

And I am satisfied here
with that little one on my lap.
The sun is shining, there is no reason
with bad weather and strong winds
to go cycling with that child.

As long as he doesn't become a footballer,
they might kick him half to death.



As long as he doesn't become a footballer,
they might kick him half to death.

But better still
then the plate for his head
of the businessman,
because that only makes him worse.

Now you never have to put your coat on
and hope your light does it.
Let the storm wind rage outside now,
in the dark.
because inside it is warm and light and good!
Hand in hand look out where the rain falls,
I see the fire of hope and doubt in your eyes!
and I know your deepest fear !!

'Cause you can't be sure
and everything passes.
But,
I believe (5x)
in you and me!

And when you get up in the morning I'm with you
and maybe I've already made some tea!
And when the sun shines outside we walk,
through the dunes.
And when it rains we go back to bed.
Wake up slowly for hours,
floats through time.
I see the light through the curtains.
And I know the past is no certainty.

Because you can't know for sure and everything
passes.
but,
I believe (5x)

I turn off the lights, and the room becomes
now dark.
A street lantern outside gives some light.
And the things in the room become friends
going to sleep!
The chairs are waiting for breakfast.

And tomorrow I wake up to the smell of
bread and honey,
the glow of the golden sunlight in your hair.
and the things in the room I say them
goodnight.
Tonight we go to sleep, and tomorrow we see
well. But the things in the room
would be lifeless things ....
without you..!

I press my mustache and take the Jumbo to Morocco.
I press my mustache and grab my rushes and run.
Because I don't like all that cold and snow.
I'm tough now and will be back in the summer.

I press my mustache, because I also want to go to Morocco.
I press my mustache, because here is ice in the air.
And on my head every drop looks like an ice cream.
I'm tough now and will be back in the summer.

We ride together through the desert on two camels.
But you just put on a breast skirt.



I press my mustache, it's nice and warm in Morocco.
I press my mustache and immediately take flight.
Your mustache freezes here from Marseille to Oslo.
We are slowing down and will be back in the summer.

Um, I press my mustache. I press my mustache too. In the Jumbo to Morocco. In the Jumbo, to Morocco. What shall we bring? Which colour? A guitar and a ukulele. And a stack of records. And a stack of records, okay.

We ride together through the desert on two camels.
But you just put on a breast skirt.

I press my mustache, you are so soon in Morocco.
I press my mustache into a shit and a sigh.
So greetings here from Boudewijn and Nico.
We are slowing down and will be back in the summer. <|endoftext|>

I believe (5x)
in you and me

No one in sight, the street was deserted
I walked there alone and played guitar.
maybe it sounds strange: I had to compose
and nobody was outside, so I did it there,
but just through the silence everyone could hear
they preceded me, I was no longer alone.
They were very nice, even a bit submissive,
and listened. "How beautiful," said one.
I was compared to the great of the earth,
they also said it looked like Paul Simon,
at first I was surprised, then it started to hinder
but no one was offended no matter how angry I looked.

Then I saw the stairs, a spiral staircase to the top
and I thought: 'I'll take that one, I have to get to the top.'
And while I kept composing,
followed by the group I ascended the stairs.
And everyone sighed: 'how beautiful it is,'
he plays a new chord on each step.
And no matter how well-intentioned I wanted to be alone
but was distracted by every word.
I started to run faster as I kept playing
but they kept following me, a crazy race.
I looked down and thought, 'I have to stop.
Soon I will fall to pieces. ' I was afraid of heights.



So we went on, the audience and the singer,
caught writing new repertoire,
the stairs went higher and higher and had many bends,
but no one got tired and I just left them.
And when I got upstairs I saw tables and chairs,
white and very elegant on a very large terrace.
And over the edge far below I saw woods and fields
where the city used to be.
Elegant people sat enjoying the sun
as at a reception for the queen.
but nobody said anything, they smiled kindly
and steadily stirred in tonic and gin.

My mom said, "Oh isn't it great.
so many chords in a single song. "
It warmed me up and thought: that too.
Then I said, "Hey listen, it's not like that,
if you stay here I'll go down. "
It sounded a bit unkind but very self-conscious.
I keep writing but on my own
so I'm going down, because that's where I rest.
They nodded understandingly, but to my dismay
everyone got up and walked to the stairs.
I then decided to stay and left alone
peace came back, the fear of heights fell away. <|endoftext|> 
We used to tell each other about the Land of King John,
way back in the garden where no one came
except you and me and sometimes your dolls and the cat.
Mountains and rivers and cities are centuries old
we shouted from the sand in a few words
and we heard each other think
nothing existed outside of us
and the whole world was in our hands.

There under the lilacs far from our parents at home
the Land of King John was waiting for us
and in the evening sleep came and we made our way home
with the Land of King John in our eyes
and the fragrance of the lilacs in our hair,
the scent of the lilacs in our hair.

For years we were brother and sister at school and at home together
we got older and we got rooms to ourselves
yet we often slept together as in childhood
then we told stories close together
and later curiosity came naturally,
we discovered each other's bodies
like a new exciting game
and we knew surprise but no regrets.



There under the lilacs far from all people at home
we experienced an endless summer
and at dusk we made our way home
with the Land of King John in our eyes
and the fragrance of the lilacs in our hair,
the scent of the lilacs in our hair.

One day I had a fight with a boy from my class
who kissed you and took you to a party
I was laughed at no one who understood my jealousy
and you were suddenly a stranger because you laughed with them
that's how you discovered the world and disappeared.
I was left with the pain
about which I could not speak
and that summer I was alone for the first time.

When the lilacs bloom near the old house in summer
I better not come there again
what we felt you and I don't belong anywhere with people
I close my eyes in the Land of King John
for the big empty world around me,
the big empty world around me. <|endoftext|> 
There lies behind the dunes,
the city where I started
like green flower gardens
Kennemerland lies in the sun.

The Bloemendaal avenues,
the slums of the city
where I dreamed a future
which I forgot in the morning.

I wandered in many cities
in dark alleys
looking for who i loved
and which I never found.



Wherever I went to hunt
on loot and new lust,
here she always waits
here I always find peace.

The wind has risen
a storm is coming from the sea
and again nothing remains
then restless and with it.

So I am far from everything
estranged from who I had
and will never forget:
the dunes and the city. <|endoftext|> 
The view from the bridge is beautiful
The water flows in wavy green
And in the sunlight almighty reigns
The church the tower just like then

A seagull searches for fish in the water
The stays are high and wry
Here stood next to you with a hangover
And now today I'm going to do your thing

How am I supposed to tell the city
With silent drum or horn sound
How am I supposed to tell the city
That you won't come again
That you never go past the boats
That you never go to the pub again
That you never get tipsy
Never again in the morning
That you never smile again
That you never again in the square
Never again on a Tuesday
That you will never be here again.

Dusk is a strange comforter
And comes with drinks in the cafe
Here I sit unleashed toast
And drink for two tonight



Outside the stones await me
Of this town my sweet prison
Illuminated so warmly by rossi light
And yes tonight I will do your thing.

How am I supposed to tell the city
With silent drum or horn sound
How am I supposed to tell the city
That you won't come again
That you never pass the boats again
That you never go to the pub again
That you never get tipsy again
That you never again in the morning
That you never smile again
That you never again in the square
Never again on a Tuesday
That you would never be here again.

But the city has not left me
She is unconditionally loyal to me
She cherishes me in all her streets
And I see her then see you <|endoftext|> 
I don't hunt you anymore.
I don't hunt you anymore.
Nothing rages inside me anymore
at the end of the summer,
the hunt over.

When I stopped following you
and no longer sought your tracks
by day and by night,
when I stopped chasing you
wanting you
as I imagined
like I've always hunted
never weighed, but daring,
only then did you stop running from me.
You alone, I lonely -
at nightfall -
at the end of the hunt.



I don't hunt you anymore.
I don't hunt you anymore.
Nothing rages inside me anymore
at the end of the summer,
the hunt over.

Now you are who you really are
you give me more than i could dream
you give to me
only when you find
that it has come this far
and rest on the shore of the lake.

I don't hunt you anymore.
I don't hunt you anymore.
Nothing rages inside me anymore
at the end of the summer.
You alone, me lonely
at nightfall
at the end of the hunt. <|endoftext|> 
I remember well the first time I had to perform somewhere,
was on a Saturday evening in "De Kolenkit" a church in Amsterdam-West.
I had driven there by tram from the central station,
guitar in a plastic cover because it was raining like hell.
A room with some neon light and eighty-five chairs
on which eighty-five good young people from the Reformed Church
jeans, pencil skirts, freshly washed faces
and a bunch of happy bible agogen volunteers
And there I was with my Spanish guitar
nervous and with a head like fire.
I had eight songs in my repertoire
for an hour's performance
so i laughed a little and coughed a little and tuned my guitar
and sang the whole trade casually two or three times in a row
but they liked it and I drove back to the station relieved
my hard-earned yellow in my pocket,
it was still raining but in the tram there the sun was shining:
From now on I was in the business.

ref:
It was a nice time,
we had fun for ten,
it was one crazy party
so I was not allowed to see you again:
'It's been nice.'

A beautiful summer day on the way to a tent in Roeselare,
a show at half past nine so we had plenty of time,
windows open, a little weed, the wind in our hair,
guitar in the trunk, until Lennaert suddenly asked:
"There have been no signs for a long time now
Shouldn't we have been there by now? "
But in Belgium, signs were usually behind trees
or behind parked cars or they were illegibly small
so I said, "Don't worry, honey
we'll still be on time, "
but in the meantime we had been driving for an hour or so
in complete solitude.
And then suddenly To saw a sign that was clearly placed
and on which it read in large letters: 'welcome to Nazareth'
and while I lit a fresh joint cheerfully and carefree
and we bravely chugged on with the two of us
it was Lennaert who spoke dejectedly the ominous words:
"Damn God, Bo, we've gone too far."

ref.

With four vague hippies in a farm in the countryside of Drenthe,
Persian carpets on the floor, clouds of incense in the sky,
big plans for a beat band, a lot of talk and little money.
I thought a long way ahead - I thought - but it was a sad step back.
The days slow and icy blue and cold and black the nights,
inside the smoke and the atmosphere was often to cut,
even my love was unable to soften my dull despair.
I didn't mean this when I once sang "there will be other times"
In the west I said goodbye To,
abrupt and heartless,
I had kind of explained
that I chose English texts
but after a month or so I thought: 'They can do something, there is nothing but talkin'
and then I boned the hippie people out with incense and all.
Spring came, summer passed, autumn hung over the field.
In desperation I had left my love
and on the last hot day I called Lennaert
"I'm sorry," I said, "we need to talk."



ref.

I also toured for a year with Sjon, Piet, Ernst and Henny.
A band that mainly consisted of talent and good will,
hardly any experience with each other so everyone said: 'don't know that'
but we had fun and we really wanted to so that made a lot of difference
and so we drove an old Duck and a comfortable Toyota
a summer and a winter long from Ostend to Maaseik.
And that it often sounded cheated did not interest us one iota
"Music is what you feel," said Ernst, and we agreed with him.
Besides there were plenty of girls,
enough for everyone
so we had a bad show
then they helped us get over it.
After a year we stopped as we had planned
I learned a lot from them thanks to their friendship and talent.
Two years later Henny called because Ernst had asked him
to join his band on bass guitar,
"I don't know if I can do it," he said, "but I really enjoy doing it
What do you think? "And I said," Go ahead. "

A Sunday in November in the Haarlem concert hall,
recently renovated and around the corner from Lennaerts monument,
a chic hall with organ pipes that gleamed like a Christmas ball -
Everyone was ready for a unique event
a marathon that would last nine hours, including the breaks
on the occasion of Lennaert's death exactly three years earlier -
I would send most of our repertoire upstairs singing
so I was hoping he would hear it back there behind the heaven's gate.
All in all a piece of cake,
I would be right there again.
Besides, I had a masterful bond
so that nothing could go wrong.
Afterwards a lady said, moved: what a magical feast
and what an eternal shame that Lennaert cannot be there
this marathon of yours was truly one nostalgic party
of old songs and memories.
To which I said, "Okay, but To was there himself
Then I wouldn't have been here singing for six hours. "

You and I it sounds so normal you and I it's still a dream
Without you I just don't think about how this can go on without you
Because I am crazy about you and wonder what am I doing
Come on, come with me, yes, I have a really good idea

refr .:
    I want to dance with you tonight
    Tonight we will go wild for a while
    A samba or a swinging lambada
    Such a party, no really nothing is too crazy for us
    Tonight we are going to put the flowers outside
    Tonight all my dreams will come true
    Tonight I really want to share everything with you
    Then we are together for an evening

Life can be so beautiful every day,
O-hooo A-haaa
But only when the sun shines in your heart
O-hooo A-haaa

It's not always a rosy fragrance
give life a color
wherever you are in the world
there is something everywhere
then this again and then that again
no one knows what will bring you today.

Chorus:

Every day is a fiesta
One-two-three
It's a party for you and me
Un-deux-trois

Live today and don't think about tomorrow yet

Today, I am dancing through life
My mind full of joy
And I know that nothing is impossible
Without you, without passion there is no way out
Live life every day
You have to live every moment

Because without you I lose control
Because for your love I'm dying
Without you there is no end



Long live life
Live with joy
I'm looking for it but I can't find it
Long live life
And live it every day
And tell me that you want my love

Today, I'm looking around the world
The freedom of a tramp
To feel what it's like to be free
Without you, I know I wouldn't make it
I would be unhappy, ay every day
And live what I feel

Because without you I lose control
Because for your love I'm dying
Without you there is no end

Long live life
Live with joy
I'm looking for it but I can't find it
Long live life
And live it every day
And tell me that you want my love <|endoftext|> 
Enjoy together in a warm bubble bath HE.
Lying down, well that really sounds like HE.
In my apartment and a far too small balcony HE.
I dream of the summer sun.

I look outside the birds chirping and the rain rhythmically hitting my windows.
I look on google to book something because what the hell am I looking for here?
But I don't dare to take to the air so that makes no sense that I'm going to Zandvoort Aan Zee again.
Give it to Curacao what I wanted most.
Still, I have a very good idea.

Enjoy together in a warm bubble bath HE.
Lying down, well that really sounds like HE.
In my apartment and a far too small balcony HE.
I dream of the summer sun.

Hear a samba ai karamba.
No, I don't keep it all my heart is racing.
A merenge on the crazy.
Get the creeps so I'll sing again!

But now you are very far from me, I don't know how you are

The house here is so empty now, and I won't turn around it

I wanted to sing as a child
Start a career
I was only nine and made a record
Sold them on the street
I still remember how I started
Sung in many bands
There was always a song with us in the evening
That's how it went no, I won't forget that

refr .:
    Our dream has come true after all.
    Our dream here in this big Ahoy '
    You were the first, the show of your life
    No nobody takes that away from us
    Our dream



Fans who gave confidence
I've grown to love you
Wherever I am, you will follow me
Wherever I am
You have to fight for your happiness
And attach the audience to you
Sing a laugh and a tear with your heart sometimes
Your strength is your voice
But stay who you are

Our dream <|endoftext|> 
The noise from the elevator keeps me awake
all nights
At home I had a refrigerator of that kind
My backpack is in the corner
been waiting for days
Until I leave as I should

And I know what you would do
want to say
It's nothing, this is the way it goes
And I know, nothing is out
to lay
There is no love in this hotel
and no hate

Come closer - get closer
come closer
Come closer - get closer
come closer
Come closer - get closer
Come closer - Come closer

Remains in the dark of my head
grind it
I'm not mad, I'm not sorry
But what should I do with that backpack
full of stories?
When I leave as always

And I know what you would do
want to say
It's nothing, this is the way it goes
And I know, nothing is out
to lay
There is no love in this hotel
and no hate



Come closer - get closer
come closer
Come closer - get closer
come closer
Come closer - get closer
Come closer - Come closer

You sleep so deeply, my love
And I so light, and you
You are far away, my love
But I want you here, close to me

Come closer - get closer
come closer
Come closer - get closer
come closer
Come closer - get closer
Come closer - Come closer

Come closer <|endoftext|>

I recognize your own start
And sang like you with all my heart
Just in Dutch
That's how we get the chance
Here we are, a few apart

        As a boy I was at the front
        And saw you on stage
        I then thought of 1 thing
        When I sing later too
        It also has to go without a hat

refr .:
    Now we are both artists
    One young, the other old
    This has been the case throughout our lives
    Because you like to sing a lot



From Roodeschool to Maastricht
Are you singing in bright light
That is not what counts
Such a gold record and money
But sing with your eyes closed

        I feel your love for a song
        Sometimes cheerful, then again with sadness
        But always honesty
        Sometimes with a little regret
        It's like you see that in you

        When someone gives flowers in the evening
Do you know why you sing and live
        A girl in row eight
That smiles at you for a moment
        That's your stage that you float on

I recognize in you my own start
        I sing like you with all my heart
Just in Dutch
        That's how we got the chance
        Here we are, a few apart <|endoftext|> 
I recognize your own start in you
And sang like you with all my heart

Here we are, a few apart

As a boy I was at the front
And saw you on stage
I then thought of 1 thing
When I sing later too
It also has to go without a hat

[refr .:]
Now we are both artists
One young, the other old
This has been the case throughout our lives
Because you like to sing a lot



From Roodeschool to Maastricht
Are you singing in bright light
That is not what counts
Such a gold record and money
But sing with your eyes closed

I feel your love for a song
Sometimes cheerful, then again with sadness
But always honesty
Sometimes with a little regret
It's like you see that in you

When someone gives flowers in the evening
Do you know why you sing and live
A girl in row eight
That smiles at you for a moment
That's your stage that you float on

I recognize in you my own start
I sing like you with all my heart
Just in Dutch
That's how we got the chance
Here we are, a few apart <|endoftext|> 
When the night has no dreams
Whether the sun isn't shining
Fear of what the day brings you
And the light disappears

Then this song will ease the pain
See you some sunshine again
Listen to good advice
So that things go better

Chorus:
No, no one ever sees my tears
I will keep them very well
Even though I am very sad
Nobody ever sees that about me
It's just part of life
But a tear can give nothing
That's why you see all day ... only my smile



It's not always a rosy fragrance
What life brings
But give it a little color
So that you are someone

Do you sometimes have a sad feeling?
That's what I mean
Then remember my words
It will bring you good luck

Chorus

That's what I mean
Then remember my words
It will bring you good luck <|endoftext|> 
Tomorrow the sun will shine again for you
Then life smiles again, no, don't look back
Because today has passed, you should quickly forget
A thousand tears that you have cried will no longer exist
Tomorrow the sun will shine again for you
It is like this every time so don't ask why
Because as long as there are still stars high in the sky
The moon smiles at you and you can do anything again



Tomorrow the sun will shine again for you
Tomorrow the sun will shine again for you
It is like this every time so don't ask why
No you don't ask why
Because as long as there are still stars high in the sky
Shine stars for you
The moon smiles at you and you can do anything again

Tomorrow the sun will shine again for you
Then life smiles again, no, don't look back
Because today has passed, you should quickly forget
A thousand tears that you have cried will no longer exist
Tomorrow the sun will shine again for you
It is like this every time so don't ask why
Because as long as there are still stars high in the sky
The moon smiles at you and you can do anything again
The moon smiles at you and you can do anything again. <|endoftext|> 
She smells of gum, tea and incense
Intoxicatingly well blended
Like she's doing it on purpose
As if it should be like this
As if there really is no other way

We blow up bubbles and balloons
Her breath and mine
The whiskey and the wine
As if it should be like this
What is driving me away from her?

At home I still lie for hours
Awake from waiting
Until she calls to say
How good it was today
That they never have a day like this
Dared to experience
Because it's too perfect
For the rest of our time



She smells of gum, tea and incense
Warm and heart confusing
She doesn't mean anything by it
That it should be
And that drives me away from her

At home I still lie for hours
Awake from waiting
Until she calls to say
How good it was today
That they never have a day like this
Dared to experience
Because it's too perfect
For the rest of our time

Because it's too perfect
With what is left <|endoftext|> 
Very short and to the point:
I can not anymore
I do not want anymore
I won't be either
Who you want me to be

Wild and ephemeral
But meant
Through everything
And pure as gold

And now
Are we older and wise
But colder than ice ever gets

Beautiful and true
A great feeling
But without purpose
Or price



Silent and attentive
But black and blue
I remember you
And me

Now time is slowly stopping
Are we older and wise
But colder than ice ever gets

One day this water thaws again
One day we will melt further away
But now
Are we colder than ice <|endoftext|> 
I'm looking at some pictures here now, from a year or so ago
We had just got together then, sitting in my first car
I took you for a ride
The journey has been going on for so many years now, in love and lost, longing for you
In a little while, then you will be my wife

refr .:
    You will love my bride early tomorrow
    When the bell is loud for us
    I feel as small as a child again
    When we stand before the altar
    And the yes word sounds spontaneous
    Love will be eternal for us



I often had so many questions, where is paradise?
Is there such a place for me?
Until I got to know you, it was my most beautiful trip
My search was really over then
I think back to that time very often with pleasure
Because I didn't regret that love

refr, <|endoftext|> 
I'm coming down, find the newspaper
Put it aside unread
There is a lot going on
With you with me with everyone
But I am hopelessly alone
On this doormat
And I think
I had to go somewhere today

Roughly speaking; this is the deal
Or I rediscover it again
Or I search with heart and soul
To the happiness that is around the corner
Free me from all duty
I can have
And I think
I have to go somewhere today

Because you never know when
And you wonder why
But you know one day
Either you must or you may
I'm ready now
Ready for, ready for



I stop at the intersection
Left or right makes no difference
I have everything I want
But what I want is the problem
I am hopelessly alone on these stones
And I think
I have to go somewhere today

Because you never know when
And you wonder why
But you know one day
Either you must or you may
I'm ready now
Ready for, ready for

Because you never know when
And you wonder why
But you know one day
Either you must or you may
I'm ready now
Ready for, ready for

It happens once
But you never know when
And you wonder why
And you know one day
Either you must or you may
I'm ready now
Ready for, ready for <|endoftext|> 
Oh, there is so much to be desired
You don't have everything under control
It keeps raining and blowing very hard
In the blessed land.

Oh, there are so many limits
Between whom should be friends
But they keep shouting and arguing
In this tiled square.

Oh, put this in good hands
Oh, it breaks so easily
Oh, don't miss this opportunity
And being right is not happiness.

Oh, there are so many people
They often get in each other's way
Or wringing hands at life
And nobody says anything.



And oh, there are so many commuters
Back and forth between places
Their heads spin from the endless travel
And suddenly it doesn't work anymore.

Oh, put this in good hands
Oh, it breaks so easily
Oh, don't miss this opportunity
And being right is not happiness.

Oh, put this in good hands

Hundred thousand things you do
There are always a few that go well
And there is plenty to screw up
What comes out of the pot tastes best

A hundred thousand things are too many
To keep up
You can go under much better
Go down in the big picture

(aaah) In the middle of everything
Is there enough space?
And you can keep dancing
Until late or early
In the middle of everything
Moves your whole body
And so we float on
Like a drop in the sea



One hundred thousand things I know
And there is a lot you forget
And there is a lot that you are hiding
Falling down every time is not bad

A hundred thousand things are too many
To count
You can go under much better
Go down in the big picture

(aaah) In the middle of everything

I think I'm going to walk
To the end of the beginning
Inside my body
Will the opening be there
Humble and small
Are my steps and my courage
But it feels good to set course
To the end of the beginning

I think I'm going to walk
Until starting is no longer possible
And the sand under my feet
In the open air disappears
Whether it is essence or appearance
Doesn't really matter
Because I just have to go
To the end of the beginning

I think I'm going to walk
I think I'm going to walk



I think I'm going to walk
To the end of the beginning
There is not much more to it
But it does give me time
And the sweet certainty
That the depth and the distance
Will always be the same
From the end to the beginning

I think I'm going to walk
Until starting is no longer possible
And I don't find what I'm looking for
I hope I recognize it
And when I get to the end
I keep walking along the river
Who winds its way
Without end at the beginning

I think I'm going to walk
I think I'm going to walk
I think I'm going to walk
I think I'm going to walk
I think I'm going to walk <|endoftext|> 
I like all those things
Which I see when I look closely
They show me something else
You are not what you seem

I get attached to it
I see them from the side
They change you and they change me
They make you real
Significant and fierce
They have told your story to me

You hit me full in the face
And full in the heart
You put me in the spotlight
Of the day

My cheeks were gray
So much time behind us
My eyes were dull and dry
But slowly I come back



I get focused on it
You will fall in front of me like this
You change the day and you change a lot more
And I am brightly illuminated
Like the moon sometimes before the sun
It's already here just for us

You hit me full in the face
And full in the heart
Even with your eyes closed
You put me in the spotlight
The full light of the day

You burn on my face
You will fall in front of me like this
You change the light and you change a lot more

You hit me full in the face
And full in the heart
Even with your eyes closed
You put me in the spotlight
The full light of the day <|endoftext|> 
There I was
No idea and no plan
Right in my house
In the middle of my night
On the floor with my guitar
I was on watch
For the song you are hearing now
That did not exist then
I played every note
Coined it word for word
But something is still wrong
And I don't know what it is
But it must be something like sugar
Something that actually doesn't fit
In a song today
But it must be something like sugar
There I was again
For the first time I know how many times
Right under my roof
Right under my moon
On the floor with my guitar
I was in the front
With the song I wrote then
That came out of nowhere
Just gave himself to me
But where something was left behind
Because something is still wrong
And I don't know what it is
But it must be something like sugar
Something that actually doesn't fit
In a song today
But it must be something like sugar <|endoftext|> 
It's not that hard to see
That the stock is slowly running out
But maybe that's okay
Because then you have to on your own
And just try to prove it
That what you do is good

To everyone
To everyone who waits

Anyone waiting for a spring sun
To anyone who gently hopes for a miracle
To everyone who laughs everything away and always walks away
To anyone who thought he didn't dare to be brave



It's easy to know
What to do if you fall over
But it is better when you feel
That you can land safely
Because someone will catch you
And that's how it is meant to be

To everyone
To everyone who waits

Anyone waiting for a spring sun
To anyone who gently hopes for a miracle
To everyone who laughs everything away and always walks away
To anyone who thought he didn't dare to be brave

Anyone waiting for a spring sun
To anyone who gently hopes for a miracle

I'm trying my best
To stay awake
But my eyes close
I just keep my balance
On the verge of sleep

I'm trying my best
Not to say something strange
Because my mouth is almost dry
There is way too much too high
On the verge of sleep

It is late
I'm tired
Drank too much
Too much talk
Smoked too much and talk more
I'm tired
It is late



I'm trying my best
In order not to remain silent
But my silences stand out And you know what I'm hiding
On the verge of sleep

It is late
I'm tired
Drank too much
Too much talk
Smoked too much and talk more
I'm tired
It is late

It is late
It is late
It is late
It is late <|endoftext|> 
The ice tinkles coolly in my lightly misted glass
More and more circles under a hundred thousand stars
I sail through the night with myself as a compass
More and more things are coming at me from afar

The ice half melted in the warmth of my hand
More and more water with the pure gin
Sometimes you pay double for extinguishing the fire
For which you wouldn't give a penny a little later

Tonight, tonight



Tonight I look right through everything
Everything is so bright, everything is so light
Me and the whole world, everything is so clear
So exceptionally clear, and without much weight

The ice is just a film on the bottom of my glass
More and more males are waiting at my door
But I don't want to lose what was already overcome
So top me up again, because I'm drinking at full strength

Tonight I look right through everything
Everything is so bright, everything is so light
Me and the whole world, everything is so clear
So exceptionally clear, and without much weight
Clear! <|endoftext|> 
I also see that everything is different than how you want it,
Or how you would have thought
And I also understand that you don't know what it is like now
Is not what you expected
So breathe in and count to ten or eleven and beyond

Hang on hold on
There is always my arm that fits around you
And always my shoulder that keeps you straight
Even if only for a moment

It's no secret that almost everyone mainly looks to themselves
and not looking at another.
And I also understand that it seems natural if you just know that you are
can achieve much more
So breathe in and count to ten or eleven and beyond

Hang on hold on
There is always my arm that fits around you
And always my shoulder that keeps you straight
Even if only for a moment



Hang on hold on
There is always my hand that washes yours clean
Even if only for a moment
Even if only for a moment

Hang on hold on
There is always my arm that fits around you
And always my shoulder that keeps you straight
Even if only for a moment

Hang on hold on
There is always my hand that washes everything clean
Even if only for a moment
Even if only for a moment

Hang on hold on
Hang on hold on
Hang on hold on
Hang on hold on <|endoftext|> 
Everything I say now is not true in advance
I lie to myself and my life
I've been lying together all my life
Take my word for it It's true
It's called survival
I can do that very well
I laugh and lie to make my life more enjoyable
Because I know everyone does
'How are you?'
'I am fine!'

So I stand up as the actor
Like the actor who will break the ice for a while
Hey hello pride, here's the trap
Hey hello pride, here's the trap
So I stand up as the actor
Like the actor who will break the ice for a while
Hey hello pride, here's the trap

The world would be a stage
And everyone plays their part
And when I'm at home I'm nowhere
And when I come out, I find the stage so full



You say unsure? Don't get lost at all
I find myself very good sometimes
But probably refer to the part I play then
Because for someone who doesn't smoke, I smoke a bit much

But I stand up as the actor
Like the actor who will break the ice for a while
Hey hello pride, here's the trap

There was a lot of wind, so I'm just doing something
I have both in body and life
I never actually had a line
Well, I lie
It's not much, but you have to do something

'... If the actor who will break the ice for a while ...' <|endoftext|> 
How long
How long will you stay in?
How long
How long will you be here?

Or should I already start
To let go of your eyes?
It only seems so short that you've been there
That we talk for hours
At the kitchen table
It seems only so recently that I've known you
And the clock is ticking softly

How long
How long will you stay in?
How long
How long will you be here?



I have to overcome this
I don't have to let go of anything
But everytime I see you I get scared
That you will get up later
And slowly walk away from me
With kisses and laughter
Because it's time

I don't know why this feels like this
You probably don't know what I'm talking about
It's very deep inside
From the inside...

How long
How long will you stay in?
How long
How long will you be here? <|endoftext|> 
The spring wind that was blowing
Got more sultry and you waved
It was hard to notice
That I kiss you kiss me
Lost the lust when I drove away?

You looked after me, I closed my eyes
I still saw your face but was alone
Alone with my friends and I knew it was late
And that you disappeared from sight faster and faster
I can only play, my notes and my part
That's nothing to share, and it fills my emptiness

Here I am safe, here I am strong
Here I am holy, this is my church
This is my harbor, this is where I moor
Here I can sleep, here I have to stand
Here is my heart for you

I look at you, you close your eyes
You know why I'm standing here and you smile
I focus on your whole being and you know I can read
What you think and what you expect from me now
I can only play, my notes and my part
I have to share that here, it fills my emptiness



Here I am safe, here I am strong
Here I am holy, this is my church
This is my harbor, this is where I moor
Here I can sleep, here I have to stand
Here is my heart for you

Here I am safe, here I am strong
Here I am holy, this is my church
This is my harbor, this is where I moor
Here I can sleep, here I have to stand

Here I am safe

This is my church
This is my harbor, this is where I moor
Here I can sleep, here I have to stand
Here is my heart for you <|endoftext|> 
My sleeves full of aces
And silly bouquets
And wipes intended for too much bleeding
Now that the knife is constantly working on both sides ..
And I'm slowly dying ...

It's okay, as long as it's painless
It doesn't matter, as long as it brings peace
It doesn't matter as long as I know
That you will be with me
It's okay, it's okay
Now that I can't help myself
Cannot stop bleeding
Now that the vein is so exposed
That everyone sees that man over there at the table
Won't make it to the end of the day

It's okay, as long as it's painless
It doesn't matter, as long as it brings peace
It doesn't matter as long as I know
That you will be with me
It's okay, it's okay

My sleeves are full of jokes
Cheap but comical
And to learn very well for those who have some patience ...
I now shake myself empty, I want to lose everything
because it's in the way and I don't have much time ....




It's okay, as long as it's painless
It doesn't matter, as long as it brings peace
It doesn't matter as long as I know
That you will be with me
It's okay, it's okay

It's okay, as long as it's painless
It doesn't matter, as long as it brings peace
It doesn't matter as long as I know
That you will be with me
It's okay, it's okay

Under the sun and a blue sky
Streets wait for residents
or passers-by from afar
And I open my ears and try to get to the bottom of something
Which I suspect exists
But nothing really sure
Do you hear the city?
My heavenly addiction
Can you feel the breath?
Between dusk and night
I get lost every time

And the voice of the sea
Take me home
I am not a Hemmingway

Debajo de la luna y un cielo estrellado
Mujeres esperan sus hombres
O las gentes que pasan
Tomándome mi mojito, imanginando
The donde vengo después del viaje
Y que abrazo mi amada

Pruebas el mar?
Mi corazón escondido
Sientes el aire?
Entre la madrugada y el sol
Siempre me pierdo



Y el sonido del mar
Me devuelve a casa
No soy Hemmingway

And the voice of the sea // {Y el sonido del mar}
{Me devuelve a casa}
Take me home
{Y el sonido del mar}
And the voice of the sea // {Me devuelve a casa}
And the voice of the sea // {Y el sonido del mar}

Passar a corrente do rio

A saudade de amanhí £

The country was not mine
And the sea not deep enough
For the indefinable distances
What my heart asked for
I can only get to you
In the dreams ahead



Between you and me
The memory of later
The now so salty water
Had promised to be sweet

Never go home
(deixo o meu lar)
Everything remains free
(vou sequir livre)
The roofs and blankets
(sem mais amarras contra a maré)
Don't mean anything to me anymore

It's reverse homesickness
And the promise of the sea
And I take that desire with me

Between you and me
(entre nós, entre nós)
The memory of later
(a saudade de amanhí £)
The now so salty water
(o mar é tí £ o salgado)
Had promised to be sweet
(um mar de saldado)

Located the oldest bridge in the world
Meet me half way
And I'll be with you <|endoftext|> 
Your showers make spots,
in a snow-white mood
I've got my hands on your hips
But my head is at the door.
They say it works
I've tried it.
But however I turn or turn it,
My house no longer protects.

It's raining harder than I can handle
Louder than I can drink.
It's raining harder than the ground can handle,
Harder than I can handle.

Your showers are the clouds,
To a heavenly mood.
I've got my hands on your hips
But my head is at the door.
your eyes remain gray,
Deny any color.
It's like nobody lives here
As if nothing is happening.



It's raining harder than I can handle
Louder than I can drink.
It's raining harder than the ground can handle,
Harder than I can handle.

Your moods are too dark
For a heavenly mood.
Because my head is in the clouds
And my hand already at the door.

Harder than I can handle,
Louder than I can drink.
It's raining harder than the ground can handle,
Harder than I can handle.
It's raining harder than I can handle
Louder than I can drink.
It's raining harder than the ground can handle,
Harder than I can handle. <|endoftext|> 
Strange that I thought
That everything would be beautiful
When I left
Away from home
And that I would really be free
Without home
But I didn't know about you
And you didn't know why
And when you asked me
I said nothing and so enough
Strange that I thought
That I could travel
With a circus
Where everything is allowed
And that I would then be myself
Every day
But I didn't know about me
And you didn't know why
And when you asked me
I said nothing and so enough
My song can be so sad
But it comforts the foolish heart
My heart broke because it wanted to
But your pain was reflected
Strange that I hope
That everything will be fine
When I go back
Back home
But that is against your better judgment
Because I'm homesick forever <|endoftext|> 
He is very controlled
He is a harmonious person
Pretty unsprung
He does his job and gets his pay
He is very controlled
He is a balanced person
But it is being consumed
By his dearest wish

He preferred to go for a drink with a friend
Throw in the money he earns
He preferred to go for a drink with a friend

He is very controlled
He is calm and capable
Checked
But sometimes he stares out the window
And he wonders
Or it wouldn't be better
To leave
Because his world is so small

He preferred to go out all day
Roaming through an unfamiliar city
He preferred to go out all day



He is very controlled
It stays neatly in place
Another first
Even though he is still in such a hurry
He is very controlled
He wanted it to be different
Learned nothing yet
From all that turning on its axis

He preferred to have sex with a woman
Who doesn't know him but would love him
He preferred to have sex with a woman

He preferred to go for a drink with a friend
Throwing in the money he earns
He preferred to go for a drink with a friend <|endoftext|>

Don't be afraid, walk straight ahead and say soft sweet words
The door is wide open, I hope you smile and hear me
When I think out loud about the night
Which we found on the street and which no one really expected
And when I say that wild confusion suits you much better
Than you ever imagined

Heart to heart
It can't get any closer
Mine holds me back
Yours sets me free
Heart to heart
They both add up
Mine in you, yours in me



Do not hesitate, look through me, our souls are old
Leave the door open, and don't dwell on what you don't trust
Take from me the fire and the strength
You need to learn to walk again
And don't be alarmed by the wild confusion that suits me much better
Than I could have ever hoped

Heart to heart
It can't get any closer
Mine holds me back
Yours sets me free
Heart to heart
They both add up
Mine in you, yours in me

A beautiful and great desire
Put us next to each other
Don't explain it, don't explain it
The world is never finished
I kiss your tears away
Sail on mine
But don't leave me, don't leave me ...

Heart to heart
It can't get any closer
Mine holds me back
Yours sets me free
Heart to heart
They both add up
Mine in you, yours in me
I'm you
You are me <|endoftext|> 
take my dreams at face value
indulge in fantasies
got me caught in you
don't know what happens to me
I warm myself to your voice
lay me to rest in your arms
hold me just a little
until i can sleep

Mijn wrakken zijn saved
Mijn hart is vrij van angst
Geen seconde of minutes
Forever you are long
Ik hoef niet meer te zoeken
Ever bent my overvloed
Ik geef me aan je over
Je zit me in het bloed



I'm beside myself with joy
wants to go down with you slowly
lose headless, carefree, weightless in you
cover me with caresses
take in the storm, the night is short
peaceful, loving, overwhelmed by you
It's so nice that you exist

come tell me something
chat with me
I want to get fed up with you
always be with you
fill me up with life
leave me in your arms
hold me just a little
until i can sleep
Ooohh hold me so that I can sleep <|endoftext|> 
When I get on the train I am alone again
Without my keys and without what belongs
Without fleeing and without a word
When I get on the train I'm not going anywhere

I keep my hand on my heart tonight
Don't mind me when I'm breathing or talking
Gentle in myself when things aren't going well
Because I keep my hand on my heart
I keep my hand on my heart tonight

When I pick up my coat, I'll be alone again
Over the doorstep and away from my house
Homeless everywhere and at home everywhere
When I pack my bag later I have nowhere to go



Where people play with lives and too much fire
Where the battle is struck in the very last hour
That ticks away because it just has to be
Too bitter for you and too small for me

I keep my hand on my heart tonight
Don't mind me when I hum or sing
Gentle to myself about what didn't work out
I keep my hand on my heart

I keep my hand on my heart tonight
Don't mind me when I'm breathing or talking
Gentle in myself when things aren't going well
Because I keep my hand on my heart
I keep my hand on my heart tonight <|endoftext|> 
It's okay while it lasts

Whole years, or an hour

But take what's yours

Take my love, take my fire

It's beautiful as far as it goes

The whole world, or the street

But take what's yours

Take my love, take my hate

If you leave

Then pretend we're halfway there

Halfway through

So far from the end.

It stays warm as long as it burns

All your heart, your mind

So take what's yours

Take my body in your hand

If you leave

Then pretend we're halfway there



Halfway through

So far from the end

Then be still

Then don't say anything to the pain

Halfway through

But give me the feeling

That I can go back

If you leave

Then pretend we're halfway there

Halfway through

So far from the end

Then be still

Then don't say anything to the pain

Halfway through

Halfway through

if you leave .. <|endoftext|> 
when I die tomorrow
then tell the trees
how much I loved you
tell the wind
who climbs the cathedrals
or falls from the branches
how much I loved you
tell a child
that is young enough
to understand

tell an animal
maybe alone
by looking at it
tell the houses of stone
tell the city
how I loved you



but don't tell anyone
they wouldn't believe you
they wouldn't want to believe that
just a man
just a woman
that a man loved a man so

if i am you <|endoftext|> 
I'm never going to worry again
I've been doing that all my life now
something different every day
that's how you keep going

never gonna worry again
put them in a garbage bag
and you stamp that whole trade
and put everything in the trash can

tomorrow the garbage man will come
tomorrow the garbage man will come
you can keep it
but what's in it for you?
tomorrow the garbage man will come

all those fears and those doubts
all those things in your cup
I'm never going to worry again
because that only keeps things going



never gonna worry again
put them in a garbage bag
and you stamp that whole trade
and put everything in the trash can

tomorrow the garbage man will come
tomorrow the garbage man will come
you can keep it
but what's in it for you?
tomorrow the garbage man will come

all that crap in the world
we're making a mess of it
if that continues any longer
the garbage collector is really coming tomorrow

he really isn't going to worry
he puts everything in a garbage bag
and he stamps all that trade
and he puts everything in the trash can

tomorrow the garbage man will come
tomorrow the garbage man will come
you can keep it
but what's in it for you?

times are different
or is it different in my head
may never have looked closely
perhaps too lightly believed

and it always has been
maybe this is how it goes
it gets dark faster and faster
it is getting earlier and earlier

it will take some getting used to
but even getting used to that
everything changes again
when you're gone

shit you have to leave now
just when things are going well
it gets dark faster and faster
it is getting earlier and earlier



however much you would like
you don't do anything about it anymore
the things that happen
go as they go

but great those few moments
what it's all about
it gets dark faster and faster
it is getting earlier and earlier

don't believe in heaven
don't believe in hell
you are born and you die
and it was

there is only life
the life you make
it gets dark faster and faster
it is getting earlier and earlier <|endoftext|> 
for the magic in your eyes
for the click of the moment
for the necessity of dancing
for feeling who you are

for the water on your lips
for scalding the layer
for shouting from the throats
for the craving for it like

I came here
and I'm not leaving here
before I succeeded
sing you what I say

for the colors of the evening
for the sparkle when you smile
for cyclists with headwind
for the stars in the night

for longing for floating
for the friendship it makes
for the love that will show
for the tingles on your skin

I came here
and I'm not leaving here
before I succeeded
sing you what I say

for celebrating freedom
for the drink that is spilled
for the airing of the hearts
for quenching your thirst



for the tapes on the walls
for the roadies in their truck
for popping together
for the shot at luck

I came here
and I'm not leaving here
before I succeeded
sing you what I say

for the heat of the lamps
for the pain that needs to be eased
for the magic of Friday night
for the father waiting there

for breaking the tension
for the comfort of all suffering
for shaking your brain
for sharing the sweat

for the fire that must not go out
for the flowing of the blood
for the landlord's money
for the muscles of the crew

for the sparks of desire
for the hunger for the party
for the dent of the music

and for you
of course
most of all

for the magic in your eyes
for the magician <|endoftext|> 
it was late with little moon
i walked home done enough
my warm bed my dear love
and happily continue tomorrow
she spoke to me from a porch
I hadn't even seen her standing there
for she was black and there was much night
she asked if I still knew her

I looked at her and saw her face
in the little lantern light
well no not really honest
I wouldn't know
the glitter of silver paper
her eyes a little away from here
she laughed a little and told me
that she had not forgotten me

much night and little moon
much night and little moon

we went to the same school
learned the same monkey
but I was older
she was a number of classes below
but I had to know her just check
the only black in the street
that stands out in such a neat neighborhood
those gardens those garages



much night and little moon
much night and little moon

I vaguely remembered
that street again with a rose hedge
around every garden and on the sidewalk
a black girl with braids
a little black girl on a bicycle
and something was wrong somewhere
her mom and dad were white
so those weren't the real ones

much night and little moon
much night and little moon

we stood there I looked at her
almost the same age now it can be strange
and not fair and not good
we said goodbye best
when I looked back I saw nothing
no more braids, no rose, no bicycle
a flame in a porch
that would soon blow out

much night and little moon
much night and little moon <|endoftext|> 
Miss from the record store
don't think another bumpkin like that
that comes here in your bowl grits
and doze on a stool
with such a large headphone on
and buy something? niente nop!
Miss you know that I'm not like that
you don't want to pretend you don't recognize me

that's me on sale
there I lie on the big pile
profit almost for free
nobody knows what that record is
all my heart and soul
not lost on the pavers
that's me
on the big heap
ready for demolition
in sale



Miss you have been working here longer
then you probably know famous singers
who sell shelves full here
and walk in so nice and slowly
pops by for his PR
boxes full of a real star
Miss you have known me for quite some time now
nobody wants me you will never lose me again!

that's me on sale
there I lie on the big pile
profit almost for free
nobody knows what that record is
all my heart and soul
not lost on the pavers
that's me
on the big heap
ready for demolition

Miss shut your business
take me to your apartment
forget the record business
it is all not true
let them have it
with their record reviewer
I sing to you
live
on the edge of your bed
my entire repertoire <|endoftext|>

dog barks in the night
blind walls bark back
rats climb out of the moat
city ​​on her back
car stops hitting doors
step into silence
man? woman? late job?
no home no sense
then silent and dark again
a distant tower battle
the city breathes
for the day

city ​​at night
silent and dark
what you hear
is like a hard complaint
smothered in wet pillows
from the city at night

It throngs at the gates
It's pounding on the ramparts
It rattles locks
It's stamping off the coast
It hits heads
It kicks nuts
It cuts the legs
It burns in the rest

Ghosts and phantoms
Ghosts and phantoms

It ferments in the cellars
The neighborhoods are rumbling
It haunts people's minds
It cuts into our flesh
It gnaws at us
It plagues our conscience
It plagues the mind
It feeds our fear

Ghosts and phantoms
Where do they come from?
How far can we get it?
How far do we let them go?
Ghosts and phantoms
What are they talking to us?



It shakes the pillars
It hits the walls
It is a trick
It pisses in the barrel
It's pulling the ropes
And it dents confidence
It cuts into the roots
And takes away our lust

Ghosts and phantoms
Where do they come from?
How far can we get it?
How far do we let them go?
Ghosts and phantoms
What are they talking to us?
How far can we get it?
How far do we let them go?

And there is no wall that high
No minefield so wide
No tank that strong
No bullet goes that straight
And no oath is that expensive
No dictatorship so cruel
No barbed wire so sharp
No fire that hot

Ghosts and phantoms
Where do they come from?
How far can we get it?
How far do we let them go?
Ghosts and phantoms
What are they talking to us?

What are they talking to us?

everyone is there and I am there
friends friends but not mine
although I am here I do not count
nothing is as lonely as a packed cafe

they laugh and they cock and I hang out
they have fun but not with me
I am here alone and not with the two of you
nothing is as lonely as a packed cafe

look an amusement park in the rain may be
when it comes to loneliness
and how about a flat tire against the wind
and no bicycle pump on the Afsluitdijk



that is all lonely and very alone
then you want to leave but where can you go?
that is called cozy here and everyone participates
nothing is as lonely as a packed cafe

with a bunch of chrysanthemums by an old love
and only her boyfriend is at home
or the disappearance of the taillights from view
from the last train home

everyone is there and I am there
no one heard what I just said
although I am here I do not count
nothing is as lonely as a packed cafe <|endoftext|> 
you dance with me
or is this not dancing
not a step too much
we are almost standing still
you dance with me
or am I someone else

is that your smile
or something with my eyes
are we really
or do I see that badly
you dance with me
or do we float above this

is this a dream or does it just seem so?

it feels like slow motion
slow motion
it goes so quickly
and it never comes back

you dance with me
these golden hours
in this tent
this moment without end
you dance with me
this could only last for ages



is this a dream or does it just seem so?

it feels like slow motion
slow motion
it goes so quickly
and it never comes back

it goes too fast
I am too slow
it is too much
I want too badly
it was so beautiful
so beautiful
but where is it today
a sickness low in my stomach

it seemed like a dream or was it?

it feels like slow motion
slow motion
it goes so quickly
and it never comes back

can't do it again
in slow motion <|endoftext|> 
Abolish the sun - De Dijk

Get rid of the sun, pull the plug
from the stars that stand there
Take a broom through the Milky Way,
hang a cloth over the moon

Stop the earth with that stuff
and with that turning on its axis
With that mix of seasons,
a different coat every quarter

Hit calendars in the irons,
put a spoke between the hands
It will never be the way it used to be

Get rid of the sun pull the plug
from the stars that stand there
Sweep the Milky Way under the rug,
turn that pear out of the moon



Immediately also pick those planets
from their endless orbit
Because I've seen it like that
there is nothing left for me

Get the bells out of the tower
stop ticking time
Don't let a morning ever shine again
no average hour, respite

Stop the sunset sky with colors
Let nothing, nothing more happen
Bring me oblivion

For what color, for what eyes?
Let it be black, forever night

What is it necessary for?
when my sweetheart stops smiling?

Do away with the sun or the stars,
let that moon be over
Leave everything that shone like that
cease to exist with her <|endoftext|> 
watch him staring out the window
from his meager office
on the sixteenth floor
the weather is bad his window is dirty
and he lights up another cigarette
that will be his thirtieth that day
he is a private investigator
and therefore frugal with his smile

and he does believe in the good
of humanity and so on
but no dog comes to see that
they want action blood and murder

anonymous phone calls
corpses in his stairwell
rich blondes with criminal records
he only takes another drag
enters a murky gambling house
without knocking on the door
for a tip of the veil
that will be matting and nagging again



never even a helpful person
never a smile never a warm hand
they would rather see him go than come
and preferably lace

bad women
cheap whiskey
dark alleys
it is an unequal fight
tough guys
false dogs
always rain
how bad the world is
he does believe in the good
of humanity and so on
but he doesn't have time for that now
he's engaged in a murder
to a pretty innocent girl
that probably knew too much
of a government official
that wasted millions

he does his job for a few dollars
only smokes a cigarette
another glass of cheap whiskey
and then all alone to bed

bad women
cheap whiskey
dark alleys
it is an unequal fight
tough guys
false dogs
always rain
how bad the world is <|endoftext|> 
Of course there are bastards
Bastards and slime dresses
There are crooks and bandits
And drabbers too much
Of course there are cowards
There are bastards and villains
Scandalous, criminal,
Corrupt, criminal

Just look around you

Of course you have bastards
Do you have crooks and bitches
There is scum and misery
And plenty of holes
Of course there are racists
There are fascists and bastards
Madmen and madmen and nonos
With a plate for their heads

But look around you

We are there too
We are with most
With people who understand how to act as a friend
Through the differences across borders
See each other straight in the eye



Of course there are wars
Crimes and attacks
Is there murder and manslaughter
About trade and money
There is hunger and anger
Misery and poverty
There is strife and terror
Revenge and violence

Look around you

We are there too
We are with most
With people who understand how to act as a friend
Through the differences across borders
See each other straight in the eye

Of course there are louts
Bag washers and eats
Rioters and brawlers
Ditch the party
Of course there are jerks
There are drabbers and whiners
Tyrants, bad men
They have always been there

come to the doctor
dock it hurts
pain you don't feel
so it must be something serious
dock says no point
that you use a drink
I also like it myself
when I smell your breath

bad habits are the most persistent
bad habits are just the plague
but bad habits are the best
because bad habits taste best

enter the cafe
I see a woman
so beautiful and so beautiful
that I don't like it anymore
fall off my stool
step up to her
she asks if i always
so hopelessly do



bad habits are the most persistent
bad habits are just the plague
but bad habits are the best
because bad habits taste best

pills plasters powders cure
never again will I get rid of it
that will take a while
I take my bad habits to my grave

come into my coffee shop
light up again
until it all turns
and spins in my head
then I am far gone
in a wonderful time
go overslept tomorrow
but don't regret now

bad habits are the most persistent
bad habits are just the plague
but bad habits are the best

watch her walk down the street
that's all mine

men lined up
all the greats in the country
things got to her hand

Such a lovely evening
After such a wonderful day
Style in your eyes
But in your smile
Is this a beautiful night or not?
You see the night splendor

How beautiful your head dear
Any idea
Let me tell you this
I'm not saying no
Now everything coincides
When you smile like that
In this beautiful night
Is this a beautiful night or not?
See the night watchman

How you see me
How I crave you
Can't wait
What awaits us
As in a midsummer night's dream
A summer dream night
Feel how creamy
Now the night awaits us

Such a lovely evening
After such a wonderful day
I hope for it
But never thought out loud
How everything comes together
With all your might
In this beautiful night
You can see the night force
In this beautiful night
Do you feel the night force
Now the night awaits us <|endoftext|> 
her hair is black
the tire is hard
I feel the bass up to my rump

she has her pride
and I mine
and slowly slowly I go

down
dead in her arms
die and get up
in a t-shirt of hers
down
dead in her arms
die
just a moment



her body great
her lips red
I finish my tenth whiskey

she takes me in
she throws me back
and slowly slowly we go

down
dead in her arms
die and get up
in a t-shirt of hers
down
dead in her arms
die
just a minute <|endoftext|> 
home from work
they say I'm lucky
i have a home and work
I'm just laughing as if
as if I am grateful and happy
when I get off the bus
and walk along the shacks
with my sweetheart in the street

this does not look like paradise
that I promised her then

children from afar
play here in the pack
in a burnt-out car
on a broken up sidewalk
oasis in the rain
with too little sun
the voice of the desert
the laundry hangs on the balcony



this can - this should not be the land
what she believed in
it will never be that way again
I'll get you out of here
I'm trying my best
I arch my back
and then we drive into the night
and we will never come back

a large sledge stops
got lost around here
that should have been my car
with me behind the wheel
and you up there next to me
with that dress back on
that was a long time ago
would it still stand you?

I show the man the way from here
that I will go with you
it will never be like this again I will get you out of here
I'm trying my best
I arch my back
and then we drive into the night
and we will never come back <|endoftext|> 
It's raining and it's November:
Autumn is turning again and is approaching
The heart that sad, but more and more accustomed,
Bears his secret pains.

And in the room, where left
Daily life is performed,
Shines from the dreary streets
An uncolored afternoon light.



The years go as they went
Gradually there is no distinction
More between deaf memories
And what is lived and expected.

Lost are the early roads
To escape the time:
Always November, always rain,
Always this empty heart, always <|endoftext|> 
you look exactly like a movie star
that's because of that blonde lock
and your hair up
and the slit in your skirt
you went sailing on rough water
although your father forbade it
and the waterfall approached
and then your boat capsized
and then you grabbed a tree trunk
which suddenly turned out not to be a tree trunk
but luckily I was tarzan
filming by the creek

a crocodile a crocodile
nice for the chimney
a crocodile a crocodile
but it's not really what I want



it is damp in the jungle
and your skirt is soaking wet
so I'll carry you to my cabin
for a cold is soon caught
and I make a wood fire for you
soon your clothes will be dry
you look exactly like a movie star
with your hair up like that
and then you fall into my arms
a scream sounds from the jungle
another movie star in trouble
another stupid crocodile

a crocodile a crocodile
nice for a pair of shoes
for a jacket or a bag
or a ladies' wallet
a crocodile a crocodile
but it's not really what I want

but it was a crocodile
I never want to be tarzan again

I'm sorry dear
But I don't have time
The muse calls me
I always obey her

Don't think
That she threatens you
She doesn't believe in possession
But in me

refr .:
    Strange how that goes
    I care about you
    And I care about her
    You don't find it strange
    You are so Beautiful
    And her face
    I do not know



I'm sorry dear
But I don't have time now
She doesn't give me love
Music is what I get

Maybe you are the body
They the ghost
Nothing I can do
Always been like that

they were always in the front
if you give it a stick
then they start hitting with it
they feel cheated
lose their temper
want a simple answer
and someone for the blame

they are there again
they are there again
comeback
new boots from an old last
blunt lies of a false mind
new boots from an old last

or they live in their villas
and have a good time there
they never see a foreigner
and think it should stay that way
because if you're going to believe
what they read in their newspaper
they will soon be the strangers
in their own country



they are there again
they are there again
comeback
new boots from an old last
blunt lies of a false mind
new boots from an old last

what people sometimes think
they say that out loud
see only what they want to see
their world ends there
for what was and is to come
they close their eyes
stairs down
which is already underneath

they are there again
they are there again
comeback
new boots from an old last
blunt lies of a false mind
new boots from an old last <|endoftext|> 
Suddenly she recognizes him
And feels the fear of that time
Sooner or later he calls her
And tells her what to do
She was his once
In a different time
But love with that feeling
Never passes

For the night porter
For the night porter



Whatever she does
She can't leave
She always stays at this hotel
She has put her fate in his hands
Love with that feeling
Never passes

For the night porter
For the night porter
Isn't the war over?
For the night porter
For the night porter <|endoftext|> 
all over the pubs
all holes in the night
all the bottles to the bottom
brought all pennies

all hours of talking
until the tongue strikes three times
all friends and girlfriends
all the stones of the street

it is never enough
it is never enough
a lot for you choose
and a lot ahead
it is never enough

looked deep in the eyes
of the beauty at the bar
fallen deeply seized
and still confused



all plans are forged
in the fire of sweat and beer
big words empty hands
the porter waits at the door

it is never enough
it is never enough
a lot for you choose
and a lot ahead
it is never enough

all over the pubs
all holes in the night
all the bottles to the bottom
all pennies taken away

Where there was emptiness
are billions of stars.

The moon is sharpening her sword.
We are great and alive,

no more than a drop.
Embittered but cheerful.



Hug me. Kiss Me.
Do you still believe in

the afterlife of
a childhood? Ghosts

aroused by hangovers.
Shards in the brain.

You can't buy my medicine anywhere
My medicine is unique
You can get my medicine now
My medicine is unique
And it heals all wounds
It softens the burden you carry
And it does not just give up
It is invisible until it is audible
Until it is made audible

My medication is not prescribed
My medicine is unique
My medicine is part of life
My medicine is unique



And it's in the air high above somewhere
It's hard to see
And it takes you out of your ivory tower
It searches together with you
To your lost soul

You were looking in all directions
No sea, no sea was too high for you
And you thought your chances were gone
Until you heard until you heard it
As in a dream

My medicine
My medicine is unique <|endoftext|> 
Show some feeling dear
Have a fight, darling
Show your tongue
And say A.
Afraid of contact
Who would have thought

Happiness makes you anxious, dear
Happiness feels unsafe, dear
Milk and honey
Tastes too sweet
Prefer the pain of restlessness
In the blood



What is a man without tears
And who cannot love you
What is a man without tears
And you can't love you anymore
That's a man of stone
Yes, that is a man of stone
I wish he disappeared

Naked like a newborn
Vulnerable as a refugee
His loved ones
In their insecure embrace
Of happiness
Nothing but good

What is a man without tears
And who cannot love you
What is a man without tears
And you can't love you anymore
That's a man of stone
Yes, that is a man of stone
I wish he disappeared <|endoftext|> 
He walked home
It was a beautiful day
So late in November

Even the sun was shining
Even the sun was shining
His thoughts
Let themselves be guessed

He never loved
From a birthday party
He never loved
From a birthday party



This was just like that
This was just like that
A nice day
A gift from heaven
A gift from heaven

Tomorrow is Tuesday
Tomorrow is Tuesday <|endoftext|> 
They say it is not there
But disappeared to the south
Started a new restaurant
In the big city

Every traveler passes by there
With the turmoil on your heels
The belongings on the back
On the road or on the run

And her smile took you
Enchanted you went along
No escape
And she took you by the hand
In her restaurant

And her smile took you
Enchanted you went along
No escape
She sees through everyone
The beautiful lady from Hue



She talks with her eyes
In a secret language
Gestures in robes
In red, blue and purple

And the emperor was right
When he said a long time ago
The most beautiful are
The ladies of Hue

And her smile took you
Enchanted you went along
No escape
And she took you by the hand
In her restaurant

And her smile took you
Enchanted you went along
No escape
She sees through everyone
The taciturn lady from Hue
The beautiful lady from Hue <|endoftext|> 
Your skin is tattooed
In the language of love
However I try
I will always lose to you

You come out of the dark
Get me out of here
Lick my wounds, kiss my temples
Take me home and

Cover me, cover me
With your cloak of love
Cover me, cover me
With your cloak of love
A cloak that no one has
Only you and I keep it a secret

Mary Magdalene was my feet
Let me forget
How I got here
That does not matter



Prima ballerina
Dance your swan dance
Just for me
For me and

Cover me, cover me
With your cloak of love, oh
Cover me, cover me
With your cloak of love
A cloak that no one has
Only you and I keep it a secret

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, cover me, cover me
With your cloak of love, ohohoho
Cover me, cover me
With your cloak of love <|endoftext|>

She called after me
You're a man of stone
But I just want to
Being alone

Being alone with what I have here
My records and my video set
Humphrey Bogart kisses Lauren Bacall
A goodbye that will last a long time

What should you do when you say goodbye?
Was Humphrey Bogart a man of stone?



She called after me
You're a man of stone
But I just want to
being alone

Being alone in a city at night
At the bar and a full glass for me
Strange women cheat here
And the morning breaks their hearts in two

What should you do when you say goodbye?
Was Humphrey Bogart a man of stone?
Was Humphrey Bogart a man of stone? <|endoftext|> 
Now I can't go back
To the country I love
To the land with the white coast
To the country that belonged to you

Because of rain because of fog so dense
Just across the wavy sea
There in the mysterious shining light
There is the country where I lived

refr .:
    Land of the angels
    That was her name
    Land of past glory
    When did you cease to exist?



How is it possible that you are homesick
To a land of memory
A country you have lost
Always think about it and always sing about it

People are driven from home and hearth
It changes life once and for all
Deep within that gnawing feeling remains
How can you say goodbye to your flesh and blood

refr.

I am no longer the same
Since the day I saw you
I searched all over the world
To your lost splendor
To your lost splendor <|endoftext|> 
I don't know what got you this far
When I see you at the park at night
The car lights shine on your body
Without eyes, without memory

I guess you never had love
Not even when that was so important to you
The words that belong to you are cheaper than I thought
In a second it started raining last night

Chorus:
Get out of that world
One second and speed through that world
Get out of that world
One second and take a good look around our paradise
And don't ask for directions, because everyone is lost



In search of happiness in Kronenburg Park
At home, a woman waits ignorantly for her husband
She never felt any of his dissatisfaction
And everything stays the same when he drives home again

There was a tree there
Where
Me with my old friend
Shed a tear

And we drank on the past
The streets were washed
Through the rain

Lisbon shines in the sun
And all the grief
And all the pain
Shared together

Always been like this
Give me your grief
Bury it in the Tagus

Day
Of death
From the son
From God



There was entertainment at night
The smile of an innocent face
Lisbon never sleeps
Lisbon survived death

I drink to you my friend
Even if I don't say it

The wrong words have disappeared
I am very grateful
We are no longer afraid of the past
My thanks are big is big
Our life gives hope
The happiness that love gives
Always been like this

On the day
Of death
From the son
On the day
Of death
From the son
From God <|endoftext|> 
Now the sun is shining again
Through the windows
This house is ours
From us together

You and me
We're not going anywhere
And everyone should know
Where are we going
Where are we going

Darling
Stay here with me
Stay with me

In the middle of the night
We come together
Where we dream
Share together



You and me
Never want to be alone again
And everyone should know
Nothing is too much
Everything is whole

Darling
Stay here with me
Stay with me

Stay with me
Stay here with me

As you sit there now
With teary eyes
What is wrong
What can I do for you

Tell me everything
What happened
Maybe I know something

Linda, Linda
I want everything for you
Linda, Linda
I want to do anything for you
Linda, I want to do anything for you

We go to Paris
The Moulin Rouge
Or to New York
Broadway lights

1001 night
In 1001 hotel
Hmmm

The sun shines through the trees
In the heart of the city
This secret is ours
It became tonight this morning

Then in the land of promise
We were nobody there
You know what to expect
The fulfillment of your dreams

And I do it with love
I do it with all my heart
I love your dreams
I love your smile

And I see those faces
And then I look at you
And everything that remains today
Is left alone

And I do it with love
I do it with all my heart
I love your dreams
I love your smile



Smile
Laughing
I love your arms around me
I love your smile
Laughing
I love you around me

We pretend
You do what I say
But in truth
I do what you want

And I do it with love
I do it with all my heart
I love your eyes
I love your smile

I do it with all my heart

Leave me alone
Close the door behind you
Leave me alone
A whole life lies before you

Nothing is lost now
I didn't find what I was looking for with you

Leave me alone
Don't look back
Leave me alone
Don't think about me anymore



Nothing has changed now
I didn't find what I was looking for with you

refr .:
    I was the King
    You were my Queen
    We had an Empire together
    That there is no more

Leave me alone
Leave me alone
A whole life lies before you

This is our home under the stars
It's not big, but small enough
for our wishes: a bed,
a moon, a courtyard.



When we are tired we fall asleep
under the stars. But we are not
tired and where we reach fits
not a single word.

In the sky is the Big Dipper.
Framed by the window frame.
Constellation of our being together.
Blueprint of that happiness. <|endoftext|> 
Maybe I was quiet
And did you think what is he thinking
And maybe I do
Wanted something different
I was gone for a moment
I was not there for a while

refr .:
    Because you know dear
    It was a bit cold in my heart

I saw black everywhere
While it should have been white
And I returned
To what seemed to be a good time
But appearances can be deceiving
I just didn't know



refr. (2x)

And everything in me says yes
When I see you standing there so beautiful
And everything in me desires
To a little warmth in my heart

There will come a time
And it starts today
A time of freedom
And it may be too late
Maybe you say
Forget it

refr. (2x) <|endoftext|> 
You're more beautiful
Than I could ever imagine
I'm lost
In what is happening to me now
No fear, no guilt
But the taste of happiness
Tell me this is too good
To be true
Tell me you're too beautiful
To be true
Little blonde princess

I'll take you
To where the water
Smoothly flowing
The wind caresses your hair and
The moonlight numbs us
I protect you
For those who don't believe in us
Am I saying this is true
Am I saying this is true



Little blonde princess
Little blonde princess

In a golden cage
I'll carry you around the world
And shout from the rooftops
I have dreamed of this
And when the wind dies
The river empties again
Bursts of doubts
will it always stay that way?
I kiss you awake from your dream
I kiss you awake from your dream
Little blonde princess
Little blonde princess <|endoftext|> 
I want to get in touch
Between you and me
I want to get in touch
Let's be honest
You came to visit here as a stranger
And you didn't answer when I asked you

I want contact, no distance
I want to see if that is possible
See if that is possible
See if that is possible
See what I can do
Electricity from me to you
Electricity from you to me



I want to get in touch
Here I have a bottle of wine
I want to get in touch, join us
We drink at the end of the future
And at the beginning of our contact

Soon will be too late
Come close
And see how that goes
Look at how that goes
See how that goes
Come and see how that goes
Electricity from me to you
Electricity from you to me

I want contact, no distance
I want close
And see if that is possible
See if that is possible
Look at how that goes
With free hands ma-mama
Electricity from me to you
Electricity from you to me
Hey! <|endoftext|> 
It is not sensible
Only an idiot doesn't think
But I can't help it
I fall in love with you

What if I stay
Would that be wrong
Because I can't help it
I fall in love with you



A river that flows
Always to the sea
Dearest you come along
This should have been

Take my hand
My whole life is yours
Because I can't help it
I fall in love with you

Because I can't help it
I fall in love with you <|endoftext|> 
This morning when you drove away
I watched you
And you disappeared in a cloud
Of a rainbow so blue

So green
So yellow
So red
I wish you all the luck
In the jungle
Beware of the dark
In the jungle



Not until you were gone
I thought
And checked my mind
Hadn't lost
I found it in a drawer
I was scared
That you took it
To the jungle
Maybe you needed it
In the jungle

Do you remember
That dream I had last night
Or was it reality
That you were here in my arms
Soft as a mollusk
Soft as a sponge
Your lips were on my mouth
My arms on your neck
Hard on the ground

Last night we took a preview
In the jungle
Everything wild and warm
In the jungle
No shame
Let yourself go
In the jungle
I'll meet you again
In the jungle
In the jungle <|endoftext|> 
We are on the road all night
But do you know where to
To that hotel where it was
It was always at the end of the road

refr .:
    We request a room for two
    And you say your name is Boeijen
    Request a room for two
    After the wedding party
    I belong with you and you with me
    Back in time



Your neck is soft I feel I feel
Your heart against my cheek
Wedding night
I wish I wish it could always be like this

Nanananana Whohoho Nananana
Laura, Bob and Ellen
guitarists all three
with voices like the morning wind
from Nashville, Tennessee

One night Bobby saw Laura,
it went great for half a year
Until one day Laura had to see
what Bob secretly did with Ellen

Nanananana Whohoho Nananana

As poor as it is sad
she wrote "nothing left to loose"
And that song hit the billboards
Both in country and in blues

The whole nation feasted
and cried very hard with her
from that cowboy with the loose belt
and poor Laura B

And Bobby breaks the pose
because it had not happened that way
and he wrote his own truth
And that four-quarter time also caught on



And Ellen a little pissed off
And a very good new contract
So the title song of her ceedee
How she broke up with Bobby

Laura, Bob and Ellen
naaanaaa
Laura, Bob and Ellen
nananana whoo nanana

Laura has now arrived
and on the film set in the sun
heard "one time stupid"
with which Bob won her heart again

Ellen was less successful
she recovered pretty badly
it hurt when she saw the pictures
from Laura and her Bob

Laura B and Bobby
sing three to the top ??????
wrote sorry Ellen
and deserved

And Ellen also sang sorry Ellen
she covers her own suffering
and it got even bigger as a hit
than when Bob did it with Laura

Spoken:
They are going to sing a song
(Laura bob and Ellen) And that's why I sing this song too
(Laura Bob and Ellen)
because we are 18 albums further now
(Laura bob and Ellen)
And me, I am completely bankrupt now
(Laura bob and Ellen)

Last night I was awake again, Mom
For everything I don't know
And I had a solution for nothing
Except my ass
Not that I don't care
But what do I know about it
Sometimes I thought: 'suppose that ...'
And that was it

Last night I was awake again Mom
Just got out of bed
And as if I didn't have enough shit
Turned on the radio

All night the Beatles, mom
And that word every hour
I'm so sorry mom I'm so sorry
John Lennon was murdered

The Son of God was back on Earth, Mom
Same message, same hair
And All You Need Is Love, so beautiful
But apparently not true



Let me sleep
Let me sleep
Let me sleep
Let me sleep

This morning when the newspaper came Mom
Did I come up with the solution
I gave it back
I returned it
To the boy who brought him

And only then did I come across that sentence
Which does hit the truth:
Life is what happens to you
While making other plans

The Son of God was back on Earth, Mom
And Imagine was his word
So the world is paradise
And I have not heard that it is dead

Let me sleep
Let me sleep
Let me sleep
Let me sleep
Let me sleep <|endoftext|> 
Then come to me


If things go badly
If you don't remember
And that for days
When it gets dark
When the rain falls
No way out, no insight
And afraid of everything

Then pick up your bag
And slam the door behind you
Walk out of town and run out of that hole
Dry your tears, let it blow there you go

And then come to me
Then come to me
Then come to me
Then come to me



If you want to hide
If you're looking for a shoulder
But you don't find him
If you want to cry, if you want to scream
The world, the fault of your life-size grief

Then pull up your collar, stick your head straight against the wind
Don't let yourself be touched
They're not going to hurt you
Don't be afraid of it, what then? Walk on man!

And then come to me
Then come to me
Then come to me
Then come to me

And then don't think I know
I also have no idea
I play the beacon at night
A stubborn farmer's dick
Which also looks the best but does
To at least stand still
And the tendency to keep hitting all help away is suppressed!

And then come to me
Then come to me 3x
Together we can take on the world! <|endoftext|> 
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

No one has ever done to me
Did to me what she did to me
There was no one here against me like that
Never did when she did

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down



The first time I'm in love
Immediately takes my life
I never had anything to lose
But anyone who wants to keep something gets scared

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

By giving me something for once
To give herself as she did
No one else can ever get over that
After her none as she knows

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down <|endoftext|> 
Ten years, the summer high
Under every rainbow
Enough gold for life
But now you discover
That it wasn't that simple
Where has that time gone now

And whatever you do
It will never work out again
The world is tumbling over the edge

And although you can cry
You run to hide
You turn around
And puts your head in the sand



Be welcome underground
We hope you will stay with us
And wipe the sand from your eyes

Here you will be initiated
How life is lived
No one has ever been cheated here

And whatever you do
It will never work out again
The world is tumbling over the edge

And although you can cry
You run to hide
You turn around
And puts your head in the sand <|endoftext|> 
The fog has lifted
The fields are clean again
I know, it took a long time
But that's just me

Sometimes it misses on my fields
And then I quietly withdraw
Until I fix it myself

But I'm almost there, really
I'm almost there, really
Do not leave me
Not now, not now
But don't come here just yet
Not now, don't come here just yet



Don't be afraid of me, girl
I'm not a fool, just not
I just want peace and quiet
Which apparently left me
Which apparently left me

I'm almost there, really
I'm almost there, really
Do not leave me
Not now, not now
But don't come here just yet
Not now, don't come yet
Don't come yet

And meanwhile in my head
I promised you a song
But it already has more than a thousand sentences (don't come yet)
And then suddenly there came the bridge
And I took back all my words
Because I would never dare to sing it
So why start such a song?

Don't come here just yet <|endoftext|> 
come to me love
come here
stroke my hair
kiss my cheeks
say sweet words sweet
tell me how sweet I am
and laugh your smile
dear sweet

you know me? yes right?
see my eyes
taste my lips
feel my hands sweet
tell me how stupid I am
and that you love me
and how much you love me
and forgive me for screaming what I don't know
and that I am silent about what is so clear
that I never really say what I mean
and shout things that I don't feel

come to me love
come here
laugh your tears smile mine
dry your cheeks sweet
tell me it's over
I'm not getting away anyway
I'm never going to leave



because it is all only sweet for such a short time
it's all over in no time
and you know that stuff of mine
that keeps things like that
so wipe the hair from my eyes
kiss the curses from my mouth
pretend you didn't understand
then it's over
and can we go on love me and you

come here
come here <|endoftext|> 
I see a long lost man
Unable to shelter in the rain
You say 'that man I can stand against
It must not be made of sugar then '

And I warn with my eyes
But you're already walking up to him
And you take his hand, so softly, fearlessly
And the man slowly looks up
And he smiles his sad eyes
For too long no one had been nice

Hey, little man
You do what no one can do anymore
Hey, little man
You do what no one can do anymore
You only see the beauty of it
You sweet little man



I see a man who is no longer alive
Only waiting for the pain to end
You see a man who must be very rich
Because he has a lot of bags with him

And I ask him what he wants
Whether I can help somewhere
Look for money on the right, my left
takes your hand free
And the man says "that's what I wanted
he could just give me
He still can 'and we both know

Hey, little man
You do what no one can do anymore
Hey, little man
You do what no one can do anymore
You only see the beauty of it
You sweet little man <|endoftext|> 
Am alone for the last time
Don't have to wait any longer
Sense of loneliness disappeared
Never again those long, cold nights
And I think
Soon the most beautiful woman will be born
And takes her whole life
What's mine becomes hers
And from now on eat for two

It will be really different here
A bit smaller too, but yes
Everything will be sorted out again
In order

I'll go over everything again
The bell
This is the end of four years
And I walk towards the light, taking a deep breath
Love never had such a sweet face



Come in
Come in
Come in
Step into my life
And put yourself in the middle

She puts the suitcases in the hallway
She says she knew I would wait
She laughs, what is four years long
It was exactly what I expected
Not a word about that I've never been
I don't like hospitals that much
And the doctor said
Only solitude heals the mind

Come in
Come in
Come in
Step into my life
And put yourself in the middle

Just a new beginning for you <|endoftext|> 
You are still here
You are still here

In the songs I hear
In the tones that I sing
In the wind that blows around the house
Your name is crying

You are still here
You are still here

In the words I read
Mine or someone else's
In the happiness that I remember
That was ours

You are still here
You are still here



In the places where I play
Where someone else in your seat
In the audience calls for a song
That I will play for you

That's how I will always play for you
That's how you will always be to me
Because I can't lose you like this
Shall I play
Keep playing
I will sing
Keep singing
I will sing what I can sing for you

You are still here
Thank God you're still here
Because I can't miss you yet
And luckily you don't go
Desire for what was
Is a very, very sweet sadness

You are still here
You are still here
In winter on the land
When the cold captures the greatest sorrow for you
When the cold captures the greatest sorrow for you

And it is fine
It will work
And I'm really doing my best and I'm fine
And it works
Because you don't disappear
As long as spring does not come, I will stay upright .... <|endoftext|> 
Acda And De Munnik Years Far From Here

This won't be a song when I was you
because I already knew you.
It's not going to be now I keep hoping
Because it won't work I'm afraid.

It ain't no so I just keep singing
At most one thing I don't tell you.
It's way too late, one could never say right
But I'll tell you later ...


I'll be years away from here
Maybe tell you how it was
Maybe I'll say then
Maybe not until much later.

But I'll be years away from here
Maybe tell you how in love I was with you




This won't be at the bottom of your window
At most, wherever you are.
And that I hear you say another:
I once knew that boy.


I'll be years away from here
Maybe tell you how it was
Maybe I'll say then
Maybe not until much later.

But I'll be years away from here
Maybe tell you how in love I was with you


This ain't no one in any other direction
We were never allowed to follow the same path
And not suddenly did I let go of your hand
I never held your hand

But I'll be years away from here
Maybe tell you how it was <|endoftext|> 
Damn Kees, it's been a year today
That you are buried
It is strange how quickly you get used to that
Because God you know, I really liked you
I knew what you got from you
Well, what do you call that
Except that I miss you a little bit
Well, my way
Everything is the same here
Don't think, Kees, that a lot has changed
A minor thing at most
In barely 1 year
There is still star advertising
And with the political names
Is there 1 new: Drees
And there are intercity trains
And you have other curtains
Got it, I fear, Kees



Damn Kees, a year is a long time
If you don't see each other
I actually do not know
It all just goes as usual
And it turns, I think
Here also without you
Carmiggelt still writes in Het Parool
And the Apollo's go
Still to the moon
Well, your daughter is going to school now
And your son next year
Well, that's very common
And yet when I hear myself talking like that
Gaps suddenly appear
Between my clichés
Because your roses no longer bloom
Because they don't spray enough
That says something, I fear, Kees

Damn Kees, I don't know anymore
Always remember what you said
It all passes
And that the time of life again and again
Just started over
Nothing new under the sun
But that's not true, because you were just you
You wandered around here
And that is never repeated
When I see your house, you belong there
And next to a children's bicycle
I miss something too
But there is nothing else to report
Oil is still floating on the Scheldt
There are still cafes
And further I heard a moment ago
Alongside the song: Long will she live
Great, I fear, Kees <|endoftext|> 
In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors slack
Until their nightmares blare
About old Amsterdam
In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors drank
And so lame like a pennant
Go roaring in the docks

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailor is drowning
Full of beer and gram
When the morning dawns

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailor awakens
When the heat is on again
About Damrak and Dam

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors look
Pecking Zilv'ren herring
By the tail, out of control

And from hand to mouth
They hurl it their snaps
Because they will hit him
Like a cat in the mitt

And they stink of eel
In their coarse blue sweaters
And they stink of onions
With that they do their meal

And after that meal they get up
To button their pants
And then they start walking again
And it burps in their crop

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors start to spin
And pick up the girls
Belly to belly, nice and clammy

And they turn their waltz
Like a revolving sun
Thin and out of tune on the sound
From an accordion



And as red as a lobster
They gasp for some air
As if suddenly with a sigh
The music breaks down

And with an air of weight
They then argue with regret
Their Mokum girl again
Back to the light again

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors go to drink
And just drink and drink
And then drink again

Drinking on the luck
From a whore from the Red Light District
Or a Hamburg whore
Well, a good piece

Of a slut who is herself
And has bestowed its virtue
For a guilder or eleven
And then they are well drunk

And with their shaky bodies
Then they discharge their drink
Piss like I whine
On the infidelity of the women

In the city of Amsterdam
In the city of Amsterdam

In the city of Amsterdam
In the city of Amsterdam <|endoftext|> 
I forgot

I forgot
The noise
From a hundred chairs
Just left
That they crack
In the silence
Or what that should have been

I forgot
My new suit
Worn three times
Dull dark
That actually me
Without tears
Maybe it would look good

I forgot
White sneakers
Not very smart
On wet earth
I will comfort myself
With the thought
Not to be experienced yet



I forgot to eat well
Little coffee
View on the ground
A day like this
Never has a reason
To be a sensible person

I had forgotten, completely forgotten
But today, how beautiful the brain
I had forgotten that
What can best be gone

Well the grief
Never the person
Never the person
But sometimes the pain

I had forgotten, completely forgotten
How beautiful it is to lose something
Never the person but little things
To be banned from my brain
And that sometimes
How beautiful it is to lose something <|endoftext|> 
The night is over
And the heaven of fire
The game between you and me
It is best at this hour
And we don't cheat
Because that takes the longest
Slow is nice
If you've waited a long time
That's how it should be
At the start of every day

I love you and you love me

You will be there
When I wake up from now on
The morning sun is shining
On your beautiful lying nude

I love you and you love me



The night is over
And the heaven of fire
Your love for me
Is at temperature

I love you and you love me <|endoftext|> 
I didn't come here for you
hmm hmm
I didn't come here for you, even though I love to see you
why i came today
hmm hmm
came to see if I had to be here sometimes

I once left here
hmm hmm
I once left here with the fire in my step
thought there was no more
hmm hmm
but my heart must still be here somewhere

I miss me
I miss me but I am on my way
I miss myself but I keep on leaving
nowhere at home in my place
whether before or completely beyond
wherever I am, I miss myself

always took you
hmm hmm
always with me, even though I didn't know
thought what I left behind
hmm hmm
was just my fear of not being a real bum



I miss me
I miss me but I am on my way
I miss myself but I keep on leaving
nowhere at home in my place
whether before or completely beyond
wherever I am, I miss myself

around this village the me hangs like a song
I can sing it or not
sing or not
that is false hope
when I said
this is not a song of mine

I miss me
I miss me
I miss before or completely over
I miss me

never even at home in my place
whether before or completely beyond
wherever I am I miss myself

why i came today
hmm hmm
I miss me or what I left here <|endoftext|> 
I love you
Text / Music Thomas Acda / Paul de Munnik
I love you
I love you
But we are not such a family
Make it now!

I love you
I love you

Not such a father
Not much of a mother
Not such a brother

Had a brother like that
But not now

I love you
I love you

I love you
I love you



But don't try to say it
Now go quickly!
I love you now

I love you
I wouldn't want it any other way
I would scream too
If the other would say so

I love you
I love you

But maybe once
Maybe once
Then don't be alarmed
I say it once, more often not

But I never want never again
Never the chance again
Never again: what I wanted to say so badly
I'm saying it now
And shut up
I love you <|endoftext|> 
I like almost
Almost sleeping
Can kiss
Can see
1 more turn, 1 more movement
1 more movement, 1 more look
One more can and then
1 laugh maybe

I like almost (love almost)
I like almost
Almost
Almost with her
I like almost (love almost)
I like almost
The one more I am done

I like almost
Almost there
Only two steps away
(two steps from)
I like Ah! (there is the finish line)
There is the finish line
Almost stop, almost
Done and almost finished



I like almost (I like almost)
I like almost
Almost, almost with her
I like almost
I am almost there
It's not over yet
Not passed by

That murmur right through your body
Of it almost coming!

I like just not serious
I love you but don't ask
Because I love much more
'Dear, we are almost there'
We climb hard
And it is the top that you see
But we are not on top yet
Luckily not

It's coming, it's coming
it's almost there, almost there
That murmur right through your body
Of it almost coming <|endoftext|> 
When I wake up again in the deep night
And again the dream has not softened the day
I secretly look sideways in half asleep
And you think here with me

Or when I wake up wet with panic
That I don't know where I am anymore so sick
Then I think how it was, it was then you
And I think you are here with me

Or alone for hours in the car
Van shouldn't have a name on its way to nowhere
Then I know that I am borrowing from the past
When I think of you to me

Who gets into bed with a damaged heart
Quickly gives his dream a bad start
But sometimes I drink myself so damage free
That I think you with me

And sometimes I still write, and almost what I mean
But no pen has been found yet that knows words
For what I feel
What I would most like to put into words
Do you sometimes think of me?



I just kept that you and me
You care, I know you never trusted
But I don't need you to love you
I think you are here with me

I think you are here with me
I think you are here with me <|endoftext|> 
Do you want to know how?
Do you want to know what you are doing wrong
How everything can be better
Come to me I know all about it
Do you want to know how it should be done
Shut up, I'm talking
How the world should turn
I know it all so well

And I know all about it, I know about everything
Because the drink is in the man

I know better
nobody understands me
I know better
And I'm sorry
I know better
nobody understands me
I know better
And I'm sorry

Even though you have studied everything
I've learned it all and better
What do you want to know come here
I get my wisdom from my beer



From four in the evening until early in the morning
I give lectures in the pub
From beer four to beer eleven
Insulting comes naturally

And I know everything about it again
Because the drink is in the man

I know better
nobody understands me
I know better
And I'm sorry
I know better
nobody understands me
I know better
And I'm sorry

And I know all about it
Because the drink is in the man <|endoftext|> 
The night is over
And the heaven of fire
The game between you and me
It is best at this hour
And we don't cheat
Because that takes the longest
Slow is nice
If you've waited a long time
That's how it should be
At the start of every day

I love you and you love me

You will be there
When I wake up from now on
The morning sun is shining
On your beautiful lying nude



I love you and you love me

The night is over
And the heaven of fire
Your love for me
Is at temperature

I love you and you love me <|endoftext|> 
It's the middle of the night and everything is quiet
As far as I can see is mine
The world has changed hands
Nobody knows
Except us
I'll wake you up later
And tell you
You can say where we will go
Somewhere in my world the sun rises
Somewhere in my world, we're coming

Hear!
Hear!
The sun is breaking through

It's two in the morning I wake you up
And I'll tell you everything I've come up with
The world has changed hands
Happened while you were sleeping, love
It happened last night
Get up and look outside, it's yours now
You can say where we will go
No suitcases, listen to the morning



Kiss Me,
Kiss me again
Then we can go
Hear! Hear!
The sun is breaking through
Hear! Hear! The sun is breaking through

It is two o'clock in the day and I wake up
And when I look up the world is too much light
No suitcases ready, so the plan has changed
I turn and see that smile on your face

Hear! Hear!
The sun is breaking through
Hear the sun break through <|endoftext|> 
Pride and the fall
Text / Music Thomas Acda
Everything I say now is not true in advance I lie myself and my life I lie together all my life Believe my word It's true
It's called survival
I can do that very well
I laugh and lie to make my life more enjoyable
Because I know everyone does
'How are you?'
'I am fine!'

So I stand up as the actor
Like the actor who will break the ice for a while
Hey hello pride, here's the trap
Hey hello pride, here's the trap
So I stand up as the actor
Like the actor who will break the ice for a while
Hey hello pride, here's the trap

The world would be a stage
And everyone plays their part
And when I'm at home I'm nowhere
And when I come out, I find the stage so full

You say unsure? Don't get lost at all
I find myself very good sometimes
But probably refer to the part I play then
Because for someone who doesn't smoke, I smoke a bit much

But I'll stand up as a starter
As a starter that will break the ice for a while
Hey hello pride, here's the trap



There was a lot of wind, so I'm just doing something
I have both in body and life
I never actually had a line
Well, I lie
It's not much, but you have to do something

'... As a starter who will break the ice for a while ...'

is a reference to a text by Simon Carmiggelt. <|endoftext|> 
Here in my room
I'll write a letter to you
Why did you leave us
went to that other woman.
That I don't know where you are.
Makes my heart burn like that
I therefore send my letter
to the sweetest dad in the whole country.

Come back to me
and make my heart happy again
Then we can
be together again
I can not live without you
Because I love you,
because I love you.



You always called me
Your sweet teddy bear,
And before going to sleep
you sang your songs over and over.
You were my greatest friend and
also my ideal
you were the best and the strongest dad of them all.

Come back to me again
and but my heart happy again.
Then we can be together again
I can not live without you
Because I love you,
because I love you. <|endoftext|> 
You are already looking ahead, tough and determined.
Cans that melt when you hear your sound.
You kindly endear everyone you see.
Happy through life, such a smile and I enjoy.
Even though you've only been around for a very short time, I'm never worth a penny without you.

Even though you're miles away, I live for you my little superstar.
Know that I am and always will be there for you.
Even though you're miles away, I'm singing to you my little superstar.
Know that I am and always will be there for you.

You are already watching me sweetly and in amazement.
In the evening before going to bed, watching football on TV.
You subconsciously enchant the women you see.
Mothers will keep your daughters at home in about ten years.
Even though you've only been around for a very short time, I'm never worth a penny without you.



Even though you're miles away, I live for you my little superstar.
Know that I am and always will be there for you.
Even though you're miles away, I'm singing to you my little superstar.
Know that I am and always will be there for you.

You are special, best friend of mine.
With a smile, you make the world happy.

Even though you're miles away, I live for you my little superstar.
Know that I am and always will be there for you.
Even though you're miles away, I'm singing to you my little superstar.
Know that I am and always will be there for you.

Know that I am and always will be there for you. <|endoftext|> 
Walking along the beach, in love holding hands
I was lost for a while
a girl like you
that you saw something in me
yes that was beyond my understanding

If you smile then it is a miracle
a woman like you, that is quite special
all days, I will ask you
how much you love me

Come with me, let's sing together
all my worries are over now
when you smile, I fall for you
you are for me alone

Come to me, I will hug you in my arms
and your warmth goes through me
dream my dream all night
you are never alone again



When we go out dancing in the glow of the
Moon
then time stands still for a moment
a song rings through the night
the stars shine softly
I know, I never expected this

Come with me, let's sing together
all my worries are over now
when you smile, I fall for you
you are for me alone

Come to me, I will hug you in my arms
and your warmth goes through me
dream my dream all night
you are never alone again <|endoftext|> 
I see you on the dance floor.
You hang around looking at your phone.
Seems like you've been wanting to go long ago.
I take a few steps forward and just as if I just walk Past, but in the meantime I am close to you.

I pretend I can dance.
But see that you ignore their best moves.
Come up with a better plan on the spot.
I take your hand and ask you to dance the stars of heaven with me.
And maybe a lot more after that.

Eyo Eyo
you and I forget everything we know everything around us.
eyo eyo
you and me floating over everyone for a moment.

It's like I already know you.
The way you look at me feels very trusting.
Feel free when I'm with you.
I give myself up and ask you to dream of a long life together tonight, and maybe a lot more after that.



Eyo eyo
You and I forget everything we know everything around us.
Eyo eyo
You and I float over everyone for a moment.

Eyo eyo
You and I forget everything we know everything around us.
Eyo eyo
You and I float over everyone for a moment.

What I want from you is that one kiss.

Eyo Eyo
You and I forget everything we know everything around us.
eyo eyo
You and I float over everyone for a moment.

Eyo Eyo
You and I forget everything we know everything around us.
Eyo Eyo
You and I float over everyone for a moment. <|endoftext|>

It was a fine day
I remember seeing you.
You were dreaming
Silent in the summer sun,
You didn't look up or back.
Didn't see me coming
I didn't even know your name
But when you saw me standing there.
I saw in your eyes
Love and early happiness.
This couldn't go wrong
Wash upside down.

You are more beautiful than the stars at night,
I never expected anything so beautiful.
I can not live without you.
You are in all my dreams.
Our love will never pass away
Because now you will stay with me forever
Forever the woman that I love so much



It was a fine day
I still remember seeing you
But you were dreaming
Silent in the summer sun, you didn't look up or around
Didn't see me coming

I can not live without you.
You are in all my dreams.

It's great that you can look at everything

Ich liebe dich, je t'aime, ti amo, "I love you in every language
In every country I keep telling my story, why I got lost in your blue eyes
From Dutch to Italian, in French or Duijts, the same song
It sounds to you when you see it that way and join me in this town tonight
how come I also had someone else

Love remains a dark phenomenon, sometimes very beautiful but often so mean
Still, I knew long enough after seeing your face
Immediately the first time I am face

From now on you belong to me, you are all

Ich liebe dich, je t'aime, ti amo, "I love you in every language
In every country I keep telling my story, why I got lost in your blue eyes
From Dutch to Italian, in French or Duijts, the same song
It sounds to you when you see it that way and join me in this town tonight
How could I ever have another. <|endoftext|> 
Now that you're out of my life
away from my existence
no one ever knows the reason
why you had to go
would fate guide your life then
your ways have already been determined

someone you love so much
you just get lost
your stories against me
are a thing of the past
would fate lead your life then
the roads have already been determined
everything has changed since
you're not here anymore



I read your name in the stars.
wherever I go, am or stand
I hear from afar in a whisper
your sound, you still live every day.

can I go on without you
time now stands still
if you were only here for a while
is all I want
all the questions I wanted to ask you
things that still bothered me
know I will miss you
and that I love you

I read your name in the stars.
wherever I go, am or stand
I hear from afar in a whisper
your sound, you still live every day. <|endoftext|> 
The rain falls gently on me
I feel alone and abandoned
How I miss you and that hurts
We need to talk
I want to be more for you than a weekend lover
I wish it was Friday
Because then I sing all day long

Chorus:
Yes tonight in the light of the stars
Does your voice sound like music from afar?
When you whisper: you are what I live for
Then it seems as if I am floating through space

Yes tonight in the light of the stars
Does your voice sound like music from afar?
Like the most beautiful love song for me
Oh this night never passed

It's Monday now, I'm alone again
You're not out of my mind
I bite through a sour apple
All those lonely nights
I want to be more than a weekend lover for you!
I wish it was Friday
Because then I sing all day long



Chorus:
Yes tonight in the light of the stars
Does your voice sound like music from afar?
When you whisper: you are what I live for
Then it seems as if I am floating through space

Yes tonight in the light of the stars
Does your voice sound like music from afar?
Like the most beautiful love song for me
Oh this night never passed

Chorus 2nd part:
Yes tonight in the light of the stars
Does your voice sound like music from afar?
Like the most beautiful love song for me
Oh this night never passed <|endoftext|> 
I am sitting here,
 thinking of you
 and ask me where you are right now

 In which city,
 in whose arm
 and if you miss me sometimes

 Maybe we were too young
 or just too stupid
 to see how good it is.

 I couldn't know then
 but I will not forget you
 wherever you are.

 Refrain:
 I'm there
 and I'll give you the world if you want.
 I'm there
 And I'll catch you when you fall
 I'm there
 and I carry you when you are tired
 if you doubt then i believe in you.



 I still have the picture
 of both of us in mind
 and ask me what you're doing
 Seems like yesterday
 your hand in mine
 I can still see you laughing in front of me.

 Maybe we were too young
 or just too stupid
 to see how good it is.

 I couldn't know then
 but I won't forget you
 wherever you are.

 Refrain:
 I'm there
 and I'll give you the world if you want.
 I'm there
 And I'll catch you when you fall
 I'm there
 and I carry you when you are tired
 if you doubt then i believe in you.
 I'm there,
 I'm there,
 I'm there ... for you

 When the storm comes
 you don't see the way
 when you hardly dare to go any further.
 When the night falls
 and you're sleepless
 when you need someone to talk to.

 I'm there,
 I'm there ... for you
 and I'll give you the world if you want.
 And I'll catch you when you fall
 I'm there
 and I carry you when you are tired
 if you doubt then i believe in you.
 I'm there,
 I'm there,
 I'm there ... for you
 I'm there,
 I'm there,
 I'm there ... for you <|endoftext|> 
a knight in a great castle
that oil sheik on his camel
a king in his golden carriage
full of soft velvet

that's me in my dreams
I'll see you come to me then
you are in all my dreams
the most beautiful princess dream

in a fairytale night
are you my queen
in the silver moonlight
I give you a gold ring
in a fairytale night
are you always by my side
the stars are shining but the most beautiful star is you



Robin Hood or Ivanhoe
a very rich pharaoh
the emperor ruling from Timboekto to Tokyo

that's me in my dreams
I'll see you come to me then
you are in all my dreams
the most beautiful dream princess

in a fairytale night
are you my queen
in the silver moonlight
I give you a gold ring

then we build our dream palace
then we are together
together forever <|endoftext|> 
Jan Smit - I sing this song for you alone

One day my dear grandmother told me
that she set out all alone
For her very last trip
To a very beautiful paradise
She then said sweet boy
When I get there
you still sing your song for me
Because then I don't feel so alone



I'm singing this song for you alone
Bring white roses for you
Oh dear grandmother I love
It's so lonely here without you
I sing this song to you over and over
And dry my tears over and over again
Oh dear grandma, I love you
Yours, yours

Staying at grandma's house with all my friends
What a beautiful time that was
We played scrabble and Yahtzee
And my grandmother always participated
And we sang together, the most beautiful songs
That grandmother knew from yesteryear
But her beautiful voice no longer sounds

I'm singing this song for you alone
Bring white roses for you
Oh dear grandmother I love
It's so lonely here without you
I sing this song to you over and over
And dry my tears over and over again
Oh dear grandma
I love you
Yours, yours
Yours, yours <|endoftext|>

those two gorgeous girls.
trying to seduce me
but I can't make a choice.

after nights of dreaming,
got out.
now i know what i want
now I finally know what I want.

i want a blonde,
with a limousine.
and enjoy tearing with her on the boulevard.

that beautiful piece.
she keeps texting me
with exciting love songs,
but that Puk is too busy for me.

Dear what was it?
I forgot your name
Honey, how about it?
How did he go again
After that night in the cafe¨
You walked with me for a while
I almost immediately forgot what you told me
But how you turn or turn it
You were sleeping in my bed
Yes you were mine last night

I am in love, but not with you
Because I'm crazy about another woman
Maybe very mean
But you are alone again
We don't really belong together

I'm in love, but not with you
I do regret our night
I'm thinking of the none
To my love before
Back to my ex, I want her

Dear, I'm sorry
I should have known better
Honey, how are you doing?
Time cannot go back
No matter how many times I resisted
You seduced me over and over
I was embarrassed by the words you said
But how you turn or turn it
I was lying there on that bed with you
Yes you slept next to me last night

It is not normal for every child to live without fear.
For them it's a fairytale story, so give them a chance anyway.

Not every child is used to getting what they want.
So realize where you were born, it's a world of difference.

Because every child deserves a home.
A close family to live with.
Where you are carefree yourself.
You are surrounded by love.
Because every child deserves a home.
A sibling to play with.
Protected hands around you.
Where you can share happiness with them.
That's home.



Not everything goes as it should, with children just like them.
Their lives have gone completely out of line, so make them happy again.

Because every child deserves a home.
A close family to live with.
Where you are carefree yourself.
You are surrounded by love.
Because every child deserves a home.
A sibling to play with.
Protected hands around you.
Where you can share happiness with them.
That's home.

How would I be in forty years,
I shut up with her.
Would I see another in the mirror
a little gray maybe.

No objection yet,
But wonder: how do you see me after so many years?


Chorus:
'Cause when I'm old and a little worn out
do you still love me
I hope as long as I know you
wants to remain my anchor.
I still want to do so many beautiful things with you
and live for every day and every kiss.


How would you be in forty years,
still that long blonde hair.
Would you see something else in the mirror
a lot wiser maybe.

No objection yet,
but imagine: what would it be like after so many years?

'Cause when I'm old and a little worn out
do you still love me
I hope as long as I know you

Rich or poor as long as we get there
in 40 years.

The light is still burning there in a Greek cafe
There is a sign closed on the door
Still I hear glasses clink, people laugh
And the song that is being played hits me

Once left then to the right and forward and back
The world upside down
Life dances sirtaki
Full of love, with hope and with wine and happiness
In a nutshell
Life dances sirtaki
And as friends we fall into each other's arms
Because tonight everyone is equal
Once left then to the right and forward and back
And everything on music
Life dances sirtaki



It touches my heart, brings me tears
The truth emerges in this song
The door opens, someone shouts: hey guys!
That's my friend, come here and don't miss this

Once left then to the right and forward and back
The world upside down (hey!)
Life dances sirtaki (hey!)
Full of love, with hope and with wine and happiness
In a nutshell (hey!)
Life dances sirtaki (hey!)
And as friends we fall into each other's arms
Because tonight everyone is equal

Once left then to the right and forward and back

Before I go to my room at night
I think about many things
I think about the world
would be without the sun
How crazy it would be if it didn't exist

Oooh life only lasts a while
Be happy when the sun smiles at you again
Yes, life only lasts
It often turns out differently than you expected

You have to give, live and take
Always do what you want, follow your feelings
Because then you know, one thing is certain
You go your own way
and that is exactly what I mean
It's the little things that do it
A pat on the back or just a kiss
You compliment
and that makes people happy
If only everyone could always be happy

Oooh life only lasts a while
Be happy when the sun smiles at you again
Yes life only lasts a while
It often turns out differently than you expected



You have to give, live and take
Always do what you want, follow your feelings
Because then you know, one thing is certain
You go your own way
and that is exactly what I mean

You compliment
and that makes people happy
If only everyone could always be happy

You have to give, live and take
Always do what you want, follow your feelings
Because then you know, one thing is certain
You go your own way
and that's exactly what I mean

Oh I wait every night
on a shooting star.
I wish you would come here and say
I'm full of sorrow
It may not have been our time.
But you belong with me.

It's been seven days now,
that I can't sleep.
Recently I spoke to you at night;
you cried on the phone.
It was just a dream.

[Chorus]
Because how can I dream of you
if you don't let me sleep.
My nights are getting longer
if you don't talk to me.
I've been staring for hours
with the bed under my back.
I just wanna go to sleep
i want my dreams back!

Lie back in bed
It's as if the sun disappears in my heart.
Feels like a winter season.
Oh come to me
end that pain and cold,
because I belong to you!



[Chorus]
Because how can I dream of you
if you don't let me sleep.
My nights are getting longer
if you don't talk to me.
I've been staring for hours
with the bed under my back.
I just wanna go to sleep
i want my dreams back!

Girls that I see
are insignificant.
Not a single woman,
can compete with you!

[Chorus]
Because how can I dream of you
if you don't let me sleep.
My nights are getting longer
if you don't talk to me.
I've been staring for hours
with the bed under my back.
I just wanna go to sleep
i want my dreams back!

I just wanna go to sleep
i want my dreams back! <|endoftext|> 
It already seemed summer, yet it was only the end of May.
A day that you think will never pass.
My friends came over but I just wanted to go for a walk on the beach, just nowhere.

Then I saw you, you called me with your eyes
I looked at you and got a strange feeling.
'Cause I understood what you wanted to ask me
Come closer to me

I was sixteen, you were twenty-eight
And I didn't know much about love yet
But I understood what you wanted to say to me
I was no longer a child

Summer was coming ...

You were so free, I thought it was a bit weird at first
You wore nothing but your long blonde hair
I was shy and didn't know what to do Just stood there looking ooh how green I felt

I understand, I heard you say
You're so young, you don't know what to do
Don't worry, the night will teach you
Come closer to me...

We walked together, further along the beach
And like a boy I took your hand
But as a man I saw the sun rise again
Summer was coming

Summer was coming ...

It was summer for the first time in my life
Summer was coming, the very first time
And I was a man when the sun came up again
And it was summer



Summer was coming ...
It just stayed forever, summer

Under the green sky in the blue sun
the tin wind orchestra plays in a large rain barrel.
There it travels over the hills and through the large forest
the long procession into the mountains of the circus Jeroen Bosch.
And we talk and we sing and we all laugh
for there behind the high mountains
lies the Land of Maas and Waal

I walk arm in arm with a hangover in front.
Behind it two rabbits with a funnel on their heads.
And then the big cockerel, which lays a glass egg.
When you shake it, it snows on the Egmond Abbey.

I reach a girl my copper hand,
then two Moors come with their drags in their hand.
Then the fanfare blows in honor of the scissors,
who marries the thimble, they love each other.

And under the purple sky in the brown sun
the wind band still plays in a large rain barrel.
There it travels over the hills and through the large forest
the long procession into the mountains of the circus Jeroen Bosch
And we talk and we sing and we all laugh
because behind the high mountains lies the Land van Maas en Waal.



We have escaped the king of Spain,
he had caught us in his bed and the pantry.
We set all churches on fire with brandy,
It's cold fire, so it's okay and it won't get in the newspaper.

The suffering is over, the horizon is shining
when the dead are drunk and Pierlala disappears.
Then we praise the trumpet and also the fat dragon
and eat shortbread at night at Klaas often's party.

And under the golden sky in the silver sun
the wind orchestra always plays in a large rain barrel.
There it travels over the hills and through the large forest
the procession permanently into the mountains of the circus Jeroen Bosch.
And we talk and we sing and we laugh ahahahaa
the Land of Maas and Waal,
from Maas and Waal, from Maas and Waal,
from Maas and Waal, from Maas and Waal. <|endoftext|> 
It's Monday morning and I have to go back to school. a very long day awaits me. I keep learning that and it takes so long. before I can go home again.

just turn around and look out the window. I know you're waiting there for me. all alone in the street until the bell rings again. is really close to my heart

It's vacation again, who would have thought.
a beautiful morning, the sun is smiling.
the birds that fly. so free up there, but I'll stay here, it's too high for me there.



come on board and sail with me far across the sea (2x)

The winter was cold, but the sky is turning blue again. It's over, so don't look back. It was a party for the two of us at the end of school. we are now going to a place in the sun. don't ask me how everything will go in life, because one day dreams will come true.
come with me to a quiet deer and sail with me to the sun.

It's vacation again who would have thought.
a beautiful morning, the sun is smiling.
the birds that fly. so free up there, but I'll stay here, it's too high for me there.
come on board and sail far across the sea with me

Listen darkness my friend
how did I earn it
that I keep in my dreams
encounter the same fear?
And the vision that threatens me
and I expect it every night
with the sound of silence.

In every dream I walk alone
through endless streets,
under a chilly street lamp
I am staring into the dark night
until I'm blinded by a flash
in my face, neon light
and hear the sound of silence.



And then I see over and over again
ten thousand people, maybe more,
whisper without saying anything,
hear but not listen to anyone.
Writing songs
that no mortal wants to sing.
It remains silent
I only hear the silence.

Strange that I only now know
that silence eats into my brain.
Can't hear my words
are my gestures sometimes lost?
Because my words
fall like the rain without will,
echo of nothing but silence.

And they fear every commandment
of the high neon god,
and preach on all sides
illuminated signs as a sign
that the words of prophets
standing on the fences as a reminder.
Only silence remains. <|endoftext|> 
The Spaarne flows,
the Spaarne flows,
the Spaarne flows past.

Beyond the city where nothing is loaded anymore,
there are no more ships in front of the weigh house.
They sail on because of the bollards and the quays
have given way to traffic.

And the Spaarne flows ...



As it will keep flowing by.
The water goes, what remains is the river.
And whatever other times come,
it flows by and yet always stays here.

The Spaarne flows ...

The Spaarne flows ...

Beyond the bridge, past the last houses,
beyond the wharves and the steam pumping station.
The Spaarne flows, but not beyond the locks,
it ends namelessly in a side channel. <|endoftext|> 
When I knew why I was crying
both eyes fell dry,
what polluted my tears so much
was the truth I lied.

Now I seem to be dancing.
firmly and then free again
and all the while I watch you
and you fall in love with me.



When I knew why I was shaking
fears diminished
and when I knew why I was alive
I was no longer afraid of death.

I was damaged tired and old
wronged too often,
now i wipe away all tears
the ultimate goal has been reached

Now I seem to be dancing
while the world watches
and wipe away all tears
the ultimate goal has been reached.
Now I wipe away all the tears
the end goal is reach. <|endoftext|> 
The island in the distance
where i so many times
have anchored,
sheltered from the raging sea,

I see the high dunes,
the fire above it,
I know there is the harbor,
the lee of the deer.

I know I can't do anything else
the journey will pass
but everything gets so dark
which was clear to me.

Still, it seems hours later
or I go through the storm
still blown voices
from the old island.



The island in the distance
where I shelter from the wind -
come here come into my arms -
find a safe haven.

But one cannot be otherwise
I've heard the voice
oh no I cannot do otherwise
the stern to the north.

I'm going where the storm lands
in white madness
I have no other choice - continue -
it is going as it is.

The island in the distance
where i so many times
have anchored
I will never go there again. <|endoftext|> 
Moss and morning dew light up in the first pink rays of the sun. Flowers open the calyxes, blurred, and veiled in haze.
The witches have disappeared, and so have the kollen and goblins, the monstrosities.
Flown away on the first rays of the new day.

Was it a dream?

In a high lament, the moth summons the prey from the forest, a warm forest where it is getting dark.
Leaves leave the tracks of the moth, singing its way along suspended trunks,
along the mossy ground in the quiet shadows of a warm forest where it is night.



While the dogs sleepily wait and watch for daybreak,
Kardansus de Kobolt reads works of ancient alchemists in light vanity and vague spells.
In the alien language of sunken lands they speak to the mystical people far behind galaxies and solar systems,
from deep beneath the earth, from caverns and caverns, from buildings jealously avoided by men and
women from moronic villages in the hinterland, the people who come in droves from everywhere.

They come up the hill, fall like comets, sitting on the back of the raven: witches and kollen, goblins, polyps,
in worship before midnight. They occupied the hill in ecstasy in the black of the new moon.

The sound of their coming creates silence, silence equals horror. <|endoftext|> 
The measurements have been taken. A soft woman's voice caresses the actions of Mephistopheles, the magician of the loose land.
In the shadow of a new moon, on the edge of the rimmed world,
the magister's domain extends under a guise of very ordinary things.

Recently, in a strip of mountains, the man was equal to a woman.
He possessed the formulas by which a woman became a man.

The colors of his voice, the brown eyes in his face, the long strands of his hair,
it used with simple gestures the mountains as raw materials for the homunculus:
child outside the mother, child from the mother, like him, Torralba and Gauricus.
The spells of his lord, master magician Paracelsus, astrologer and alchemist,
now returned in the guise of the homunculus: the child outside the mother,
child from the mother, like him, Torralba and Gauricus.
In the depths of many caverns women contributed to the melting of formulas elements,
as the sand became mirrors, like out of nothing; the homunculus: the child outside the mother, child from the mother,
like him, Torralba and Gauricus.
But Swedenborgh already flew past Stockholm to see behind him the flames of catastrophe in his mind,
like the homunculus the child became outside the mother, child from the mother, like he, Torralba and Gauricus.

And there they set, the devil and Tlazolteolf, queen of the Sabbath, crowned like kings, queens, dying on earth in money and marmalade.
Princes and princesses whose wigs burn in the flames of the burning cross.
There he sits, the devil whose ass has been licked and who now feeds on the flesh of charred children.
And before his throne witches dance and sing in his honor.

Children of Arion,
children of Nerion,
children of Ur,
Balder and satyr,
children of the moon,
daughters of Varaan,
sons of Waldaan,
mention the name.

From Ra and Baldur,
children of Ur,
Myrthe and Syra,
women of the god,
behind the streams,
behind the trees,
where the trolls live.
Name the name.

Gods and satyrs,
along cool waters,
preach what is true
in the name of Ra.
Daughter and son,
lord of the throne
is Loön the Icon.
Name the name.

From Jim-John the dwarf,
niece of the mountain,
of the god Alister.
Where does the swan live?
Children of the moon,
daughters of Varaan
and the god Waldaan.
Name the name.



Call the name Arfistel,
the name Mefistel,
fold the epistle,
burn it and count to four.
Satan is here, Satan is here,
Satan is here, Satan is here,
Satan is here, Satan is here.

And then all turn aside to those who came from afar and are new, the Newly Comed.

Alegremos, que gente nueva tenemos, alegremos.

And then all give way to them. Welcome in the name of Satan and his followers. In silence they ascend as they came upon goats passing by moon and
nebula made their way here. Then they slowly walk in line to the fallen cross and trample it in disgust and rage.
In their sumptuous robes they are now approaching the throne of the evil monarch who rises ... New come are those who trample the cross. ... and raises his hand.
One kneels and waits. New are those who spit the Bible. The women with long skirts of wealth and nobility ... New are those who tear the clothes.
... smeared with mud and moss. Gentlemen who parade in the hinterland ... New are those who kiss the devil. ... as God and Gabriel and
now waiting for the baptism of the devil. New are those who offer their child. In their folded hands they offer soul and bliss.
New are those who injure themselves on the knife. They become servants and then ... New are those who allow themselves to be possessed.
... the time has come for them to take off their proper clothes. Welcome. Anything for Satan. Shabby and naked, but in utter ecstasy they are capable of anything.
Alegremos, que gente nueva tenemos, alegremos. They reverently kiss his buttocks.

Then all hell breaks loose.

They are screaming surrounded by watching trolls, kollen and goblins. The witches scream and dance. We dance, scream, split the earth.
Continuously, all the way to foam, painted in bright colors, we whip each other up and throw smoke and fire. We tear the mists to shreds and rise.
We rise. We ascend in circles and spirals, through leafy branches, cobwebs, while ravens and moths surround us and lead to above treetops and
spiers. In a daze of blazing hellfire we leave the hill, up, to Zenith and Zodiac, to hell and devil.
We, Torralba and Gauricus, Tlazolteolf, Paramon, Liba and Avernos, Palo, Hash, Gondelin, Albertus Corsius, Anthonius Vorsius and Grotius ...

The single uninvited guest, present by mistake and now left behind, sets after the chimney to prepare for sagas and legends.
The terrifying example for a people in the hinterland.

The wind scatters the sand, covering the tracks of Satan's void followers awaiting evening. <|endoftext|>

The glass dome of the sky is blue
so that the blue sun shines,
the dry hard light is blue
and also the pearls of the dew.

How long will I have to stay here
i can't know what i want.
And stiffen under me
the glass waves quietly.

Bells are ringing in the blue sky
of blue spruce in the glass ice.
Crystals slowly grow closed,
a mathematical view.



And to close the glass gate
Fahrenheit comes out of his pot there
whistle on opal glass keys,
from "Draw close to you, my God."

Yellow is the color I will never forget
here in the steppe of cast glass,
blue is the fruit that I eat with difficulty,
the shards taste sharp and cruel.

The dry silence keeps getting worse
so that I have to flee
for there behind the glass mountains
lies the land of flesh and blood. <|endoftext|> 
I recognized him from a very long time ago,
he immediately started to whine about then.
Such a conversation is to be avoided with a smile,
a mask that says nothing in return,
and still be polite.

But suddenly I thought:
I don't care either
and instead of answering stupidly
to another stupid question,
I said he was getting really bored.

I said, "I'm not putting on a mask"
"No Carnival Today"
"No Carnival Today"

I needed to talk to someone important
and was also introduced to his bosses
and I immediately noticed
they just use me for making a lot of money.



So instead of 'considering this matter'
Instead of 'my gentlemen' 'Yes of course and very much!'
I expressed the hope that they would soon be consumed.

I said, "I'm not putting on a mask"
"No Carnival Today"
"No Carnival Today"

She stood with those dreamy eyes.
as if she wanted to say 'I don't feel at home here'
because it was carnival and everything seemed to be allowed
so I turned around her
like a street cat for a mouse.

But then I thought about what I had planned
and aware of that bit of honesty and quite a bit in my collar I asked, "Would you like to come with me?"
She said, "Take off that mask first."
"No Carnival Today"
"No Carnival Today"

"No Carnival Today"
"No Carnival Today"
"No Carnival Today"
"No Carnival Today" <|endoftext|> 
I know this view from my window, the trees,
the street with all those houses on either side.
I know most of the people who live there
I vaguely say goodbye and they greet me.

This view through this window in this room,
the books along the wall, the painting
that you didn't like, the sofa, the table
it looks and hangs the same way.

Everything is the same
the same story.
Almost the same
but not quite,
just not quite.



I try to look with the same eyes
but everything stares at me stupid and meaningless
as if shine and glow were gone forever,
the soul has left everything.

Everything is the same
almost the same song.
Only you were there then
and now you're not there.

Everyone still seems to do the same
yet it is different, very different from then:
everything still seems to be the same
but now it hurts, now it hurts

Everything is the same
the same story.
Almost the same
but not quite,
Everything is the same
almost the same song,
Only you were there then
and now you're not there. <|endoftext|> 
I hold the world in my hand
the glass egg full of land and clouds.
I'm going to populate the sky
I call the ferns out of the sand.

I shake the monkeys out of my sleeve
the speckled leopards and the ants,
the blue rabbit, the doodle animals.
I sprinkle topaz, azure and dew.

I now know that I can do anything.
I know the animals by their skins
the birds by their nuts
and I give names to the man.

The paint that I spilled
suddenly catches fire,
the pallet falls flamingly from my hand.
The earth swings open
I see her walking
in my own green grass.



Do you want to be white sometimes?
that I don't know you
and that I am not omnipotent.
You want to forget me
eat my fruits
and cheat on me with your husband.

Here in your alabaster body
I see the pink flames burning
and what you want falls into your hands
you have affected my world.

There the green spotted cat sneaks
and has the blackbird already grazed,
the iguana will blow bubbles,
crawls along the path on five legs.

The fibroid rises from the water
and rings its glass strings.
There is in the crystal pillars
an owl whistling oblique songs.

Here I stand for crazy
in my dressing gown,
I thought I could do anything.
And I disappeared
then comes on tiptoe
the angel with the big knife. <|endoftext|> 
There she is, she knows who she is again.
She took off those weird clothes.
The boys have moved into the fields
to sacrifice some. And that goes wrong.



She has sensed something like that since she was a mother.
She is also shocked by the youngest.
His devout banter with his scapegoats
does not forgive another.

Her back to then, she doesn't want to step back.
And with the oldest she can learn to live,
and with his children. God is too fast
with cursing, slower with forgiveness.
There is guilt there, but this realization makes us tough:
for Cain's sake she will oppose her God. <|endoftext|> 
Come people and listen and shut up now
the water is already reaching your necks,
and admit you're wet, soaked to your shirt.
Don't try to avoid it.
And whoever does not want to drown is wise when he swims,
because other times are coming.

Come writers, scholars, prophets on paper,
the opportunity won't come again, so check it out here.
And don't say anything yet, the roulette is still spinning
and the winner is unquestionable.
But he who wins later is who lost yesterday
because other times are coming.



Come lords rulers, party boys come,
and don't hang there and don't look so stupid.
Because he who keeps nagging is he who dies.
The armies fight outside.
On the battlefield each of you is consumed,
because other times are coming.

Come moms and dads, come here and listen.
We are so tired of your talk and laws.
Your sons and your daughters who hate authority,
your morality has been boring us for ages.
And fly when the world doesn't like you now
because other times are coming.

The line has been drawn, the curse has been laid
on everything that is false and crooked and unreal.
Your beautiful past was bloody and lax.
We will avoid those mistakes.
And the man at the top is the lowest of later,
because other times are coming. <|endoftext|> 
I'm dreaming on the bridge
I see the trees in the water
I see the sky and a moment later
I feel the looks in my back
of all the people standing there
and who ask me in stern wrath:
did you really have to risk that if necessary?
Why did you do such a thing to her?

I know, it's my fault
that I should marry you too soon
but build for a pleasant nest
nature had no patience anyway.
It was such a soft night in May
but go and make that explicit
to all those ladies and gentlemen
who were luckier than us.

They say to me: you are a rag,
you are the shame of the family,
from our clean domicile.
Think about us and God too.
And one then pulls a face
like I ate garlic.
No Christian wants to know about such a guy
it hurts the sense of honor.



On Sundays people listen to the word
and everyone sing praises aloud.
But I stand outside as the culprit
of a negative murder.
Forgiveness and tolerance,
yes they are good for liberals.
Of those unchristian maladies
my family is completely liberated.

A wise uncle is a lawyer
and arranges our matrimonial affairs.
A loft with a view of the roofs
because otherwise we would be on the street.
Lady next door, who sees everything,
sits behind the window and wriggles her hands.
She shouts hurt: it's a shame,
because you become a mother, she not.

If I were your child, darling,
I'd rather not be born
then I wouldn't hear from me anymore
then I stayed where I was.
'Cause the family dear girl
is so embarrassed with the situation.
We just have the cabal against,
for they were married on time. <|endoftext|> 
Because he always gets out of bed early
and is outside at eight o'clock,
always on the same train,
goes home at half past five.
Because his world is built on punctuality
it never goes wrong.

And he's oh so good
and he is oh so fine
and he's oh so solid
and he can be proud of that.
He is highly respected
here in town
and he acts well
what dad taught him.

And his mother is going to meet
because she has claimed a share.
She is drinking tea with her accountants
while his dad takes the girl.
And besides money, she also looks
to any handsome young lad.

And he's oh so good ...



And he loves his garden so much
and he likes his cigars best.
And he is better than the rest
and his sweat smells best.
And he hopes to get the money
from his father when he dies.

And he's oh so good ...

He always goes public
because he has certificates.
He adores the girl next door
because he does not dare to talk to her.
But his mother knows best
what marriage brings.

And he's oh so good ... <|endoftext|> 
When it debuted in the 1930s,
a pale Titaantje in too wide pants,
whose delicate poí «see defied the time of crisis,
looking for higher ideals and humanity,
then his work was praised from all sides,
People had been waiting for such a talent for years.
He suddenly saw his name printed in all the newspapers,
they liked him even better than he ever imagined.
The tangerines quarreled about their leaves
and everyone had discovered him first.
He became the center of cultural talk
and although he had just begun, the expectation was aroused.

Because a child prodigy of twenty
is always a good start.
Yes, that boy can become something
yes, there is still a lot in it.

But no one can live by art alone
so it became a job at a major newspaper.
And what else he has written in his life,
had no connection with his ideals.
It was the occupation that awakened the fire.
He wanted to go underground as a hero.
He might well hit the enemy
with the inspiration of his literary violence.
He just got over the concentration camp,
but then he no longer had ideals.
And everything he could ever believe in
had been crushed with the butt of a rifle.

And a child prodigy of forty,
that is a bad case
that could have become so much,
but which will become nothing more.



Yes, he did a translation once more
or something, which could not be honored.
But his debut could no longer be repeated
and his new work was not spoken by anyone.
He has been waiting alone drinking for years
in a corner of the artist society,
where the boys hardly laughed at his jokes,
but he could always give them a beer or a drink.
They found him in his room
with a note to his children in his hand.
And only then did they write that they could appreciate him
and he got a piece in Vrij Nederland.

Because a child prodigy of fifty
does not fulfill his duty.
He shouldn't have aged,
he cheated the world, yes.

Because a child prodigy of fifty
does not fulfill his duty.
He shouldn't have aged,
he cheated the world.

Ah, a child prodigy of fifty,
after all, that's not a sight,
so to stay consistent
he closed the book himself. <|endoftext|> 
A bike ride through the water country,
I sing in sunset sky
Of two elderly in the snow,
who are waiting for death
When I'm about eighty,
I will definitely come back here,
I know I'm beautiful then
weathered with a crooked back.

I am wearing a woolen cap
in a wise head of leather,
Suddenly start crying
because I feel, I can no longer.
And then you take the car
and you take me off the land
We drive together
to the west, to the beach.



We see the sun, we see the sea,
we look at each other
one last kiss, an early prayer,
saying goodbye is not difficult.

We look for a suitable place,
forward and then right,
disappear without hesitation
in the spacious seaman's grave.
We shared our lives
and choose death
and find our eternity
at the last sunset. <|endoftext|> 
Wires - Boudewijn de Groot

never sleep again
there is too much going on in your head
never rest again
faces mixed up
in confusion and in fear
never be alone again
always those images how it was

in the jungle
in the villages, on the land
in the cities, and on the outskirts
from the abyss

never silence again
there is no end to the pain
never believe again
no one feels it
the waste and the regrets
never the same again
because you got stuck in time



in the jungle
in the villages, on the land
in the cities, and on the outskirts
from the abyss

nowhere is it safe anymore
except in the house
still an enemy
and he follows the trail
you only want to do 1 thing
runs through all the rooms
disconnect any connection
cut all wires

never sleep again
the war is over, and yet
never rest again
the distance was too great
and you tried
never be alone again
you created your world then

in the jungle
in the villages, on the land
in the cities, and on the outskirts
from the abyss <|endoftext|> 
How I would love to live with you
Every month about seven days
That is just nice, that just remains free
To be with you for a whole week
A week of eating, drinking, making love
A week in total, completely with you
A week a month, really for the two of us
A sailor's life without the sea



And just when you start to think
That you have to refuel for freedom
You happen to say
I feel like going out with a friend
Oh oh oh, we kiss goodbye
Not a tear, not a sob, yes, it is allowed
We are going back to normal
For three pleasant, full weeks

And just when I start to think
That I have to refuel with love
Do you happen to say: Do you want to
Come in with me for a week
Oh oh, then we give up freedom
Paradise for seven days
Isn't that a wonderful thought
But, I think three weeks is a long wait <|endoftext|> 
I walk the streets
I just wander around.
And I see people talking
as if you didn't exist.
A boy kisses his girl,
an old woman gently caresses her dog.
Two children sing a tune
as if you didn't exist.

That's how often it has been said
and so many times it has been written,
sung and whispered
and no matter how often not hushed up.
Hey hey I love you.

The shops are brightly lit,
I hear an organ playing on the canal.
And I see your face everywhere
as if you were waiting for me.
The cafes and dance halls are open,
luring late into the night.
And I still keep hoping
that you are waiting for me.



So many times it has been said ...

I came home
in my room chilly and cold,
then I will still dream of you
like you love me.
It has been like this for days now
and I feel: that's how it goes wrong.
So tomorrow I'm going to ask you
if you love me.

So many times it has been said ...

So many times it has been said ... <|endoftext|> 
I've known you for a long time now, although you never saw me
But the day will come when you will laugh with me
My dreams wrote on paper, I let myself go through you
Would you ever understand that wish of mine

refr .:
    I have written love letters to you so many times
    But I didn't get an answer from you
    I don't even know if you've ever read them
    Why do you leave me alone with my grief
    I have written love letters to you so many times
    But promise me don't tear them apart just yet
    Because there will come a day when you will understand them
    And then you will regret leaving me behind



Not a day goes by for me without thinking about you here
I want to be with you, be very close to you
Many months in uncertainty, when will I hear from you
Because I will not lose what I feel for you

refr.

And then you will regret leaving me behind <|endoftext|> 
When the nights are long, lonely and cold
Very often my thoughts are with you
When the hours are small, minutes are mine
And I still love you after waiting
Gone are my worries with the day of tomorrow
Go back home like many a time
The call of my first name, the scent of your body
Then you will stand there and see you again

refr .:
    But then in your arms, I want to warm myself
    Even if it is only for a moment, close to me
    But then in your arms, I want to warm myself
    You are the sun in my life, stay with me forever



When I'm away from home and don't know the language, I think about days with you
A world full of dreams that have come true
No further questions about love and loyalty
If the days pass slowly, anyway
I drive on roads, getting closer to you
The call of my first name, the scent of your body
I am well aware that I love you

refr. (2x) <|endoftext|> 
Not a tear in the brooding, burning eyes
but their mouths are harsh and grimly curved.
We weave the shrouds of society,
a triple curse woven into it.

We weave.
We weave.

A curse to that God with his deaf ears
who never seems to hear our naive prayer.
In vain our patience, our hope in that god,
he has cheated, decorated and cheated us.

We weave.
We weave.



A curse to the king, that prince of the wealthy,
our misery is a worry in his mind.
Blackmail your last three nickels if you could
and then just as cattle for the firing squad.

We weave.
We weave.

A curse to the country, if it may be called that,
where lies and deceit eat themselves like mold,
where every flower is broken for its time,
It's rotting dung that a worm thrives in.

We weave.
We weave. <|endoftext|> 
I remember so well
that time when I fell like that.
My knees were full
with gravel and blood.
You picked me up
and you carried me back home.
And you held me
until I was calm.

And when I do again
who had dreadful dreams
and screamed very loudly
during the night,
then you came to me
and then you sat next to my bed
and stroked my hair
very soft.



But then the time came
that it was no longer possible.
Because you were old-fashioned
and what you said I thought was chatter.
I told no more
what I did or what I thought
and only now do I understand
how awful that was for you.

Now I like so much
would talk to you again.
Even if only
for a few times.
Now that I want to say:
Dad ... I love you so much
now it is too late
because you are gone. <|endoftext|> 
Maria is sitting on the canal
very quietly read a novel by Courts Mahler,
she would love to be countess
waiting for her lover pale with grief.
The tea light, the lamp, the wallpaper with the roses,
signs of like with mother for young sailors
that pass outside,
grin and whistle at her.
Mary does not look up, the countess who waits,
she turns the page and smiles.



Mary is sitting in front of the window,
the canal becomes a park with the moonlight through trees,
she waits on the steps for the carriage to come,
along the pond over the driveway.
The baron with his cloak comes riding off,
the horses stand still and she goes down,
she falls into his arms, standing lonely outside
a man on the canal.
Maria looks at him, she smiles,
she turns the page and smiles.

She sees his face
a man comes up the sidewalk,
shy and hasty.
She puts the book on the table next to her,
she nods and draws the curtains.
She lets him go with staring eyes,
with its rough, clumsy body
of finally being allowed.
And she looks over his shoulder
to the flowers on the wallpaper.
He brought those roses for her,
she closes her eyes and she smiles. <|endoftext|> 
It is midsummer night
And the sky gently revolves around you
Full of paper stars
Lanterns from this earthly feast
In the warm wind
Blow your hair up
It's a flying dress
In a cloud of incense
I smell heaven here and I forget
That I don't sleep, don't eat
This hunger makes me know only one thing
Your look at me
Like water in a wasteland

Chorus:
Tell me how do you know so well
What to do in here
Love is not blind
I saw it was you from the beginning
So why am I playing this game
Between hope and despair?
Truth wins
I knew it was you from the start



The world is silent
The moment you look me in the eye
In this setting of lies
Has the end of the journey been reached?
On the balcony all around
Romeos will work up a sweat for you
Quoting the poí «et a beginning of one would never say
That you don't sleep, don't eat
This hunger makes me know only one thing
Your look at me
Like water in a wasteland

Chorus 2X <|endoftext|> 
Marijke helps her mother with the dishes,
Saturday evening and then she can go out.
She tries to make up
but she has bad skin.

Her father and her mother
drink coffee in front of the tube.
Hello Marijke, be careful.
Remember: home at one o'clock.



Line twelve runs through the rain for half an hour,
Saturday evening, to the city center.
And Marijke sees a girl
where she took dance class with.
You go to the movies
or to the disco?
But the girl sees a boy
leaves Marijke in the lurch.

Marijke is waiting for the bus again
Saturday night, the fog hits her glasses.
It's like other nights again,
an empty bus, the streets quiet.

Her mother is still up
and has prepared something tasty.
Hello Marijke, do you want something?
But Marijke wants to go to bed. <|endoftext|> 
Loneliness surrounds me, why did you leave me here alone
You look for something that is not there, but you find only sadness
I've done all I can, but don't wonder why
I can't take this anymore now that you've gone I still hear your name

I now live with my silent sorrow that you left here
Why did you go, then you never saw my tear
My world is now collapsing, if only you could be with me
Because living on without you hurts me so much



You don't let you know where you are, I've never known you like this
Or say honestly, you are sorry and you live in uncertainty
I will always be there for you, even if the chances are very slim
That I will see you again, who knows just maybe
Will you be with me again

I now live with my silent sorrow that you left here
Why did you go, then you never saw my tear
My world is now collapsing, if only you could be with me
Because living on without you hurts me so much <|endoftext|> 
Nights I still dream of you
Even though we have been together for years
Everything has come true so far
Even the smallest dreams came true

Words about you are unnecessary
What I want to say is what I feel
I don't need any promises for that
Just that happy feeling

refr .:
    I pick a star just for you
    Although there are thousands who shine
    But this one gives the most beautiful light
    And enchants your face
    Like an angel in the night
    I pick that star just for you
    So that he can never get lost again
    Will our love always translate
    And gives us the silent power



What could be better in life
When someone loves you so much
That keeps giving you the feeling of size
That a future is being built

Love is today but also for tomorrow
Because time does not stand still
Love is hidden like a treasure
The card that lies with us says how much

refr.

Will our love always translate
And gives us the silent power <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes I feel so different, I feel good about myself
But when the weather changes, you really notice it
I'd rather grab my sunglasses than an umbrella
When it rains I always get quiet, but the weather is different now

refr .:
    I smile when the sun shines (I smile when the sun shines)
    Feel bad in a shower (feel bad in a shower)
    Well give me the summer, it makes me feel so hot
    Somewhere on a terrace (somewhere on a terrace)
    Nice and lazy on the beach (nice and lazy on the beach)
    Everyone is happy again, you go whistling through the country again



The rain is tapping on the window, it is a sad sight
No more children play in the street, the doors remain closed
But when the sun starts to shine, I immediately cheer up again
The clouds disappear, everything is turned upside down

refr. (2x)

Everyone is happy again, you go whistling through the country again
Everyone is happy again, you go whistling through the country again <|endoftext|> 
I look lost, so close to you makes me alone
I feel all that loneliness now, although I haven't lost you yet
Don't turn my heart to stone now
Everything you said is the reason I fight
Fleeing is no use for you, just look in the mirror
Are your words real?

refr .:
    I can't say goodbye to you, please tell me you're not going now
    Because as long as you can still dream
    And just keep coming to me, it's not too late
    There is still a tomorrow for us, so don't stop time today
    Look me in the eye one more time, that's what I'm asking you now



Is there a reason to go, maybe I did something wrong
Then tell me what you mean and tell me what you feel
But don't let me just stand there
I did what I could, not a lie I ever made up
Is this really the last time and you just don't want it anymore
Still, I wonder why

refr.

Look me in the eye one more time, that's what I'm asking you now <|endoftext|> 
refr .:
    I can't see your tears, my heart cries for you
    The words may help you that I wanted to tell you
    Because on the way to happiness, many loves are also broken
    But not when I tell you how much I love you

A word from you sets me on fire
A smile from you is the best I can wish for
A tear from you tears me apart with grief
No live without you, I cannot and do not want to

refr.



One night with you, it seems like paradise
A dream of yours is my most beautiful trip
A kiss from you, my heart melts with amore
I want to go through life with you

refr.

Because on the way to happiness, many loves are also broken
But not when I tell you how much I love you
But not when I tell you how much I love you <|endoftext|> 
In the land of my dream
Children just play
There is time for a laugh and for drinking
Anyone who is happy
No danger and feels free
Because evil has been conquered there forever
Nobody is hungry
And there are not thousands of worries
Where I like to live
In my own dream

refr .:
    I have a wish
    A wish for sooner or later
    That somewhere like my dream exists
    Where people laugh
    Where you can still live freely and happily
    It's the most beautiful place, yes for everyone

Why must there be so much war in the world
So many people still suffer so much pain every day
Can't understand this yet
Why all this misery all the time
It remains a question for me
For tomorrow and today
I have a wish

In the land of my dream
Children just play
There is time for a laugh and for drinking
Anyone who is happy
No danger and feels free
Because evil has been conquered there forever
Nobody is hungry
And there are not thousands of worries
Where I like to live
In my own dream

I'm hopelessly in love with you, I can't sleep anymore where are you
You want to be with me in your letters
But you are not living up to those words yet
Is it really worth the wait or am I spared a lot of grief?
Is the future for us? I prefer you to say it honestly

Tell me what are friends for
I hadn't noticed your game all along
I thought we would be happy anyway
But that turns out to be only apparent afterwards



I feel hopelessly lost without you
I can't even hear your name without you
What is my life without love, without you
I can't believe anyone anymore not to mention truow
I had so many great plans for the two of us
But that now remains just an idea forever
I thought you were much more than a friend to me
But I was wrong, no, I did not deserve this

I had so many great plans for the two of us
But that now remains just an idea forever

I can't believe anyone anymore, not to mention loyalty <|endoftext|> 
It's late, count the drops on my window I'm waiting for you
With my fingers I slowly write your name, where are you now
It's a waste of time, because I know you're not coming
But I still feel the pain
I now live from day to day, I've waited long enough
But it will be better

refr .:
    I'm free again (I'm free again) like a bird in the sky
    Very alone (very alone) fled to solitude
    Without you (without you) at least I know who I am
    But your game is over now, one thing still counts for me, I'm free again



Every day, every hour, every moment, I wonder
Did I know you well because you didn't give love
It's over, but it always stays with me sometimes I look back for a moment
But that makes no sense, I don't call you girlfriend
I quickly forget that time

refr.

But your game is over now, one thing still counts for me
I'm free again (I'm free again) <|endoftext|> 
No more people, no more dreams
No future, no ideal
It's such an old story
But when will you live again
You live today, enjoy today
The sun shines for you too
So dry all those tears quickly
It's not too late

[refr.]
Life is too good for all those tears
Life is too good for much sorrow
So live your life and eat your worries
Because all those tears won't help you anyway
Life is too good for all those tears
Life is too good for much sorrow
You only live once
So think over and over
Life is too beautiful, no more tears



A child's laugh, a spring day
A bird happily sings its song
There is so much beauty, yes enjoy
Forget your worries
Many people again, many dreams again
A future, an ideal
That's a new story now
Now you live again

[refr.]

Life is too beautiful, no more tears
(Life is way too good for all those tears) <|endoftext|> 
There is still so much to do in life, don't think about tomorrow
Happiness sometimes takes a while, even if you don't have money, get rid of all those worries
Life smiles at you today is the first day, you can handle anything
Sometimes think a little differently because you can be happy
So fight for your own existence

Life is a game, it's like a carousel
you just turn around, yes around in life but everything will be all right someday
Even if the sun doesn't shine sometimes, don't be sad
Come and take the day a smile feels better, all those tears won't help you anyway



Sometimes things go a little different than you would have liked, don't think about tomorrow
Then you want to say something but keep quiet, away with all those worries
Then you do something different, oh what does it matter
You will not receive anything as a gift
Because everything that changes even if you sometimes get a little tired
But think well, it goes like this

Life is a game, it's like a carousel
you just turn around, yes around in life but everything will be all right someday
Even if the sun doesn't shine sometimes, don't be sad
Come and take the day a smile feels better, all those tears won't help you anyway

Life is a game, it's like a carousel
you just turn around, yes around in life but everything will be all right someday

All those tears won't help you anyway <|endoftext|> 
We had often talked about it together, the future of both of us
Don't expect it to end like this, although this dream is now over
You wrote a note, it wasn't my world that collapsed much more
I don't understand why you chase me, although I can get over it

It could have been so beautiful for us, this goodbye hurts me so much
All your words have touched my heart
It could have been so nice for us but your decision makes me small again
And made me a different person again



I wonder, was your love really, I don't understand how it can be done yet
The words that you have told me so often that every man will fall for
If our love doesn't get another chance, it is really too late now
Or do you run into a new romance, leaving me here

It could have been so beautiful for us, this goodbye hurts me so much
All your words have touched me deep in my heart
It could have been so nice for us but your decision makes me small again
And made me a different person again

It could have been so beautiful for us, this goodbye hurts me so much
All your words have touched me deep in my heart
It could have been so nice for us but your decision makes me small again
And made me a different person again
And made me a different person again <|endoftext|> 
Towards that dream together
To our love a crown
Always a word for each other
Sometimes with the smallest gesture
The best feeling together
Always on the way to a goal
Fight for everyone's happiness
No one can destroy that dream

refr .:
    You are the light in the darkness
    But also the tear of my sadness
    When I look deep into your eyes I feel rich
    You are the glow on the horizon
    The support I could always rely on
    Without you my life is cold, I love you
    Without you my life is cold, I love you



You are the scent of a rose
Often left me speechless
Just like a leaf in the wind
Or like the smile of a child
Eternally longing for you
What I trust my heart to
Always your smile around me
Not a day will I leave you alone

refr. (2x) <|endoftext|> 
They were still waving
In the far too small doorway
I didn't look back
Because what is over is over.
I pull my feet out of the clay
It says welcome on the doormat
But that's not for me

In the shadow of the bridge
I carried everything on my back
But I take it in hand
In the shadow of the bridge
one step further, two back
I'm going to the other side

She's waving to me
I kiss her in my mind
I never look far ahead
But always dream us together
She is eagerly standing by the window
And welcomes me with love
When I arrive after my trip



In the shadow of the bridge
I carried everything on my back
But I take it in hand
In the shadow of the bridge
one step further, two back
I'm going to the other side

In the shadow of the bridge
Where I used to crawl away
For what I didn't understand
In addition, did not want to know
In the shadow of the bridge
It kept getting a little colder
I had to feel in the dark
Couldn't see a thing

In the shadow of the bridge
I carried everything on my back
But I take it in hand
In the shadow of the bridge
one step further, two back
I'm going to the other side <|endoftext|> 
If you really know what love is, then I wasn't here right now
With a heart full of sadness and with pen and paper
I write something to say and read it ten times
It's hard to explain, but there's love for that

refr .:
    The feeling of being together, the feeling of loving
    If only I can be with you, what I long for every day
    I only have the feeling of being happy with you
    Don't let me be lonely here, don't leave me out in the cold



My dreams are only for you, you are the starlight
I wonder what am I doing, I keep seeing your face
I keep longing for you even though it hurts me a lot
Yet I am waiting for that one day when you will be with me

refr. (2x)

Don't let me be lonely here, don't leave me out in the cold
The feeling of being together <|endoftext|> 
refr .:
    I am so homesick for Santa Domingo where the sun has brought me to you
    Now I can only dream of this, even though I know you are waiting for me
    I am so homesick for Santa Domingo for the beach and the eternal sun
    Where the stars continue to shine for us until I come back to you

Far away from you, again only an empty feeling were you around me
That hot summer flew too quickly
But it remains the best time for me

refr.



I read your letter (I read your letter) ten times (ten times)
You too long for me and for amore
I'll take your photo, my best souvenir
What is written on, you were only here for a while

refr. (2x)

Where the stars continue to shine for us until I come back to you <|endoftext|> 
You rarely look for what you find
But you know there is something
In a dim and different light
You are on your way
You don't know half how far it is
You are new here, a young and clean face

It's ok
You are not alone

Because I'm waiting for you tonight
You will see me, I will be there
The best losers
That's us

That you are left with nothing
Is a hard certainty
And the ground never changes
A cold stone
Shines here in the sun
It is old, but still beautiful

It's ok
You are not alone

I'm waiting for you tonight
You will see me, I will be there
The best losers
That's us
The best losers
That's us



While the moon is climbing and you are bathing in silver
Its light shines the light on the street
You have made you you
You still look back, but hey, it's late
You still don't know what you have
But what you have lost

It's ok

I'm waiting for you tonight
You will see me, I will be there
The best losers
That's us

It's ok
It's ok

The best losers
That's us
That's us

The best losers
That's us
That's us <|endoftext|> 
There is never rest, not in my sleep
And not if I run around myself more than consciously
I am alone among the people on the street
And I talk and I know what I mean
And what I make up
It is real and I am dreaming at the same time
Come into my night
Lie with me
Watch with me
Give me the ghost
Give me the ghost

Sleep makes me wait so I fantasize
My world as it really is
There is always a truth but how you see it
Depends on your courage and your look
Of what you do
And what am I doing
Daydreamer by profession?
Come into my night
Lie with me
Watch with me
And give me the ghost
Give me the ghost

The less I sleep
The deeper I dream
The days are slowing down
Until they stop
And lazily I think I know what it is
You keep upsetting me
I see sharper and sharper
Then I don't see anything anymore
Just a minute
I call it luck
The great happiness of the mind



And what am I doing
Daydreamer by profession?
I ask you, I beg you
Lie with me
Watch with me
And give me the ghost
Give me the ghost

Bring me the time in a bottle
I give you my blood
And my head on a tray
Dance for me, naked
Lie with me
Watch with me
And give me the ghost
Give me the ghost 3X <|endoftext|> 
I laugh when she comes by
With her red painted mouth
With her red painted nails
And her tight ass

I sigh for her beauty
Dazzling, day and night
I succumb to her wink
And the look with which she smiles

She has the devil in the blood
She has the devil in the blood
And I love what she does
She has the devil in the blood

I have to swim in the eyes
Which she keeps aiming at me
And I feel my knees buckle
And I gave in again

I think about rivals
When I wait for her somewhere
And I'm disgusted with drunk guys
And the joke why she's smiling



She has the devil in the blood
She has the devil in the blood
And I love what she does
She has the devil in the blood

She does me good, she gives me fire
And I have to every day
And every hour and every moment ...

Laugh at her beauty
Dazzling, hard and soft
And I fall for all of her charms
And its weakest strength

She has the devil in the blood
She has the devil in the blood
And I love what she does
She's got the devil in the blood (2x) <|endoftext|> 
Blof That we are

You see them walking, there in the distance
They seem happy and free
They greet us happily, as if they know us
Although they only see us for the first and the last
They go further down the road, they are already over
And we so want us to be

We all dream of the others
We all dream that we are
We all dream of the wild hands
We then dream that they are ours

They turn and turn, around each other
Love, infatuation, what is it?
Their arms entwined under her coat
It must be warm, and moist and soft
And we so want us to be



We all dream of the others
We all dream that we are
We all dream of the wild hands
We then dream that they are ours

So let's just do it
As if we are walking there
Heaven breaks open
For the very last time
And we imagine ourselves
In there

We all dream of the others
We all dream that we are
We all dream of the wild hands
We then dream that they are ours <|endoftext|> 
The stop can be seen when I stand up
It is not far and it is time to leave
Although you never know whether you will make it to the last
I've already paid for the ticket
I'll take the bus home
The view is beautiful from the mountain
It always takes too short, but that's not so bad
Because when you are upstairs you have to go down again
It's good for today
I'll take the bus home
And if I could dance I would dance what I could
And if I could sing this would be what I sang to you
But I think I'll shut up now
I'll take the bus home
The drive back shakes me up after an hour
I feel good with the driver behind the wheel
I can't wait to go tomorrow
But now I enjoy some more
In the bus home
I'll take the bus home <|endoftext|> 
the fire was almost out
when the fire brigade arrived
strict but without joy
they handled their syringe
the chunks were not too bad
only minor water damage
smoke got into my eyes
and I thought about the two of us

I thought of the blazing fire
that was our love
a blazing fire with flames meters high
and how of such a blazing fire
but very little remains
how all that love flew in time



the party was already over
only then did I come up
you had already left
the room that was blue
I know that guy
I never liked him
smoke gets into my eyes
and I run into the cold

I think of the blazing fire
that was our love
a blazing fire with flames meters high
and how of such a blazing fire
but very little remains
how all that love flew in time <|endoftext|> 
Can I do something for you? The dyke

Can I do something for you?
Can I be something for you
In this bitter season
With its creeping venom

Can I be something for you
With a look, a gesture
With one arm around you
Or a hand from your hair

Can I be something for you
In your great loss
Because who loved you so much
There is now no more?

Can I do something for you?
With a look with a word
That is reminiscent of then
That you go on again?

Is there anything you want
What disturbs your silence
In the bald and the chilly
What you like to hear from me

Is there anything I can do
What helps you in the pain?
Which means something to you
I would like to be for you

Can I do something for you?
Maybe a song a poem
That you call despair
And lighten your burden slightly?



Which makes you sad
But still crying about laughs
That shortens your days
That softens your nights

Is there anything I can do
What comfort in your grief?
Because soon you will have to move on
Even if you don't want to



Is there anything I can do
What helps you in the pain?
Which means something to you
I'd love to be for you

can I be something for you
some kind of arm around you?
So that it shrinks a little less
And you not so alone? <|endoftext|> 
you are the sun that still rises on a drenched day
you are the birds in the trees and the lee after the battle
you are the open window out with the wind in the curtain
you are the one two three seconds it may always be
you are the neon in the puddles on my Friday night off
you are the city that smells of perfume like a lady passing by
you are brewing the basses and the beat goes on and on
you are the voice of my desire whispering in my left ear

and I'm telling you now
for now and forever
I will not let you go
you won't lose me anymore
because I love you
I love you

you are the knife cuts both ways and the ointment and the pain
you're the kick in my nuts or I wouldn't be anywhere
you are the heart I feel beating in the cesspool of my body
you are the song hiding there the tongue with which I write
you're the night train south away from all that crazy stuff
you are the house after long days and we are far from tired
you are the moon above the buildings in the oil on the moat
you are the stars in the dark queen of my night



and I'm telling you now
for now and forever
I will not let you go
you won't lose me anymore
because I love you
I love you

you are rattling at the gate of my wretchedness
you are the refuge from the storms in the spirit of this time
you are shaking the walls in a sacred dance hall
you are the cutest and the most beautiful sweetheart of all
you are that unexpected turn that took your life with me
you are a dream from long ago long before you came to me
you are the lightning from the mountains tearing the sky to pieces
you are the best very best thing that ever happened to me

and I'm telling you now
for now and forever
I will not let you go
you won't lose me anymore
because I love you
I love you <|endoftext|> 
in everything and everywhere
where it happened I was there
to the fullest and everywhere my friends
the big difference from then and now is you

I still remember how good I felt then
there was no end to the universe
always party you danced in my arms
proud and rich I was the prince at every ball

you should see me now
you would be scared
from your old friend
you should see me now



I have a photo I look at it all day long
from that time not even that long
that's you and the one next to it I look like
watch me laugh we laugh with the two of us

you should see me now
you would be scared
from your old friend
you should see me now

in for nothing more and not to be found for anything
where it happens it happens without me
and if I were there you wouldn't recognize me
the big difference from then and now is you

you should see me now
you would be scared
from your old friend
you should see me now
you would be scared
come back maybe
you should see me then <|endoftext|>

that one moment
nothing too short

you will be late everywhere
you never know when

all those men in their cars
idiots behind glass
afraid of not even one hundred and eighty
afraid just for a scratch
to his four in ten seconds
turbo engines and horsepower
they should all be as needed
I'm not in a hurry

I do not wanna die
on an oncoming car
I do not wanna die
in an outdoor track
I do not wanna die
if I have to leave me
go out the pipe in the gutter



all those curves in the roads
There is a risk of slipping everywhere
on an oak they are the same
2cv and jaguar
that screeching and that noise
to be the first there
you are never the very first
or you turn out to be too far

I do not wanna die
on an oncoming car
I do not wanna die
in an outdoor track
I do not wanna die
if I have to leave me
go out the pipe in the gutter

When it doesn't work out, as you hope
What you stand for will be demolished
However you prop up, they do it anyway
Just think: you will always have me!
Nothing will make it, everything shrinks and wears out
Will lose it over time, against time
But whatever comes, however it may be
We have each other, both of us
We have each other: ME YOU AND YOU ME

When things don't go the way you want
And you cannot stop that unrest in you
Your belief in the world is at risk
Then remember one thing, you still have me!
Nothing lasts forever, everything passes
Avoid in the end: already lost everything
But whatever comes, however it may be
We have each other, both of us
We have each other: ME YOU AND ME ME

When it doesn't work out what you wanted
You feel your dreams numb from the cold
And your soul will be sold for next to nothing
If everything has to go, you always have me
Even though the long duration pushes everything past
Until that hour….
Because whatever comes, whatever it may be
We have each other, both of us
We have each other: ME YOU AND YOU ME



Whatever comes, however it may be
We have each other, both of us
We have each other: ME YOU AND YOU ME

ME YOU AND YOU ME

it sings in the air

tight-faced

it echoes through the hallways
from the flats and the subways
it screams from the rooftops
it rips in the cars

it sings in the air
it pops through the walls
it hangs in the houses
it creeps where it goes
it gnaws in factories
it whines in the pubs
it hisses like a drop
on an ocean

want but can't
something must be done soon
this world too tight
no air too many doors
it won't let go when it strikes
it won't let go

crave
crave



it sings in the air
it's dripping from the walls
it falls out of the bags
of the people on the street
it is in the eyes
of boys in discos
girls in jerseys
tight-faced

it smothers on the asphalt
on Saturday morning
it comes with a bang
and it is impossible without it
it won't let go when it strikes
it won't let go

crave
crave

want but can't
something must be done soon
this world too tight
no air too many doors
it is deep inside
to bounce out
that green reptile
that bites and that sucks
at the tip of your soul
it won't let go when it strikes
it won't let go

crave
crave <|endoftext|> 
all those intrepid plans
in the innocent night
turn out not to be true
if you thought in your innocence

that things are sad
than you wanted in your dreams
that's just the way it is
but what about that
what would that
what would that be?

I have you

high-strung ideas
the whole world! everybody!
that could all be much better
singing we parted

and now I search the storm
happy with every dot of blue
that's just the way it is

but what about that
what would that
what would that be?



because I have you
so what would the rest do to me?
I love what I want
I have you

we were all together
talked in the same voice
wouldn't let anyone down
together we get stuck

sometimes you meet someone else
at a stop in the cold
that's just the way it is
but what about that
what would that
what would that be?

I have you

so what would the rest do to me?
I love what I want
I have you

I still have ideals somewhere
but I don't easily find them
that's just the way it is
but what about that
what would that
what would that be?

I have you
so what would the rest do to me?
I love what I want
I have you <|endoftext|> 
if you don't remember
in the dark of your head
they leave little intact
of what you believe in
no matter how time rushes
we have to get through it
if you don't remember
you are not alone

hold me
hold me

if I don't remember
in the rim of time
the bottom is much too hot
lost all direction
don't let me go
but get me through
if I don't remember
no one is alone



hold me
hold me

no matter how time rushes
we'll get through it
if you don't remember
you are not alone

hold me

how many trains did not come
train numero how much is this
how many trains to come
on the train I'm on now
on the way from going to coming
search for a horizon
steel rhythm sweet dreams
sometimes a stop at a new station

how many trains how many trains
how many trains still to go
how many trains how many trains
when will I arrive somewhere

how many people have not spoken
the conductor knows when
and he cuts holes in your card
and he shakes his hat off no sir
smashing through the uncertainty
too scared to stand still
in a hurry not to miss anything
further and further away from here



how many trains how many trains
how many trains still to go
how many trains how many trains
when will I arrive somewhere

how many trains did not come
train numero how much is this
how many trains to come
on the train I'm on now
wheels am i - i am wheels
wheels grinding on their axis
rails I am sleepers and kiesels
i will remain what i used to be

how many trains how many trains
how many trains still to go
how many trains how many trains
when will I finally arrive? <|endoftext|> 
Don't cry
Girl don't cry girl
Everything will be fine
Even if you don't know what to do right now
Just watch how you do it again in a while

Girl come dry your tears
Even if you still have such grief
Even if you don't see a way out anymore
It's not that old as young as you are

Do you cry my girl then?
Don't you like grief
Then cry girl just cry
But don't cry

Girl don't cry girl
Even if you are still so angry
Even if your world is ending
It really isn't - your world stands

Girl come dry your tears
Although what I'm saying now sounds stupid
Even if the suffering hits you like a bomb
Now you are broken, but soon you will laugh about it



Do you cry my girl then?
Don't you like grief
Then cry girl just cry
But don't cry

Even though your eyes now see red from your suffering
You are a hundred times stronger than you know yourself
You feel so hurt and hurt
But you are a thousand times stronger

Do you cry my girl then?
Don't you like grief
Then cry girl just cry
But don't cry

Imagine that god exists
That is not the case, no indeed
There isn't one, I know that
But suppose that god exists: suppose

Then that god bears the heavy fate
Of some real true god
Who knows everything and sees everything
That's our god! Or not?

Although I wish everyone everything
I have nothing to do with their god
Even thinks he's very bad
Only our god is real

That's how all the fuss began
While god didn't even exist
And meanwhile the devil is walking
With a smile on his face

It's our god! He gives and takes
No, our god is being claimed
It is our god of good and evil!
No, only ours exists!



Does your god exist? Then my god too!
People play with fire, a poker swings
The first stone flies through a window
And soon all hell breaks out

A few are walking away evil
Choir-like consultation follows
And reluctantly we assume
That every god must exist

That's how all the fuss began
While god didn't even exist
Meanwhile, the devil is walking
With a smile on his face

With a smile on the shit

I hurry from place to place
I'm in a hurry
Life is so short
Where do I go tomorrow
The note says:
First in the morning in Geleen
in the evening in Den Helder

You called me up
And asked how I was
You said it again
Was a month ago
That I came to stay with you



I hurry from place to place
I'm in a hurry

Rest rusts I prefer
stainless steel
But my legs are getting heavy

We celebrated in Saigon
And I contracted a disease
We behaved like an animal
With the whores of Saigon

Until one day my best friend
A mine ran from the Vietcong
I wrote my mom I want to go home
I want to get out of Saigon

refr .:
    Saigon
    Saigon
    Saigon

We smoked opium purely out of fear
The enemy was approaching Saigon
Because one day the President decided
That Saigon was lost

When it gets dark I feel that fear again
Which I felt in Saigon
The doctor says you don't live long
Because of that disease from Saigon



refr.

I lost my boyfriend
I lost my heart
I lost my childhood
There in Saigon

Now I am on my way to the White House
With my revolver from Saigon
I want to see the president's eyes
With my revolver in his mouth

And when I pull the trigger I say
Greetings from Saigon

refr.

Greetings from Saigon
Greetings from Saigon <|endoftext|> 
No I am not mad
Not sad either
Not surprised either
When you asked about it
But one thing surprised me
My feeling for you is gone

refr .:
    Once you stole my heart
    Ignorantly you gave it back
    Because you stole that feeling
    That feeling for you
    That stolen feeling
    That stolen feeling

You searched my house
When I wasn't there
I hope you liked
What you were looking for
You disappeared like a thief in the night
You never had much courage



refr.

Well now you come to your senses
Well it is too late
Everything comes and goes
I hope you will be happy
Happy and free
But without me

I don't know what got you this far
When I see you at night at the park
The car lights shine on your body
Without eyes, without memory

I guess you never had love
Not even when that was so important to you
The words that belong to you are cheaper than I thought
In 1 second it started raining last night

Get out of that world
1 second, and quickly travel out of that world
Get out of that world
1 second, and take a good look around our paradise
And don't ask for directions, because everyone is lost



Looking for happiness, in Kronenburg park
At home, a woman waits ignorantly for her husband
She never felt any of his dissatisfaction
And everything stays the same when he drives home

Get out of that world
1 second, and quickly travel out of that world
Get out of that world
1 second, and take a good look around our paradise
And don't ask for directions, because everyone is lost

And everything stays the same when he drives home again

Get out of that world
1 second, and quickly travel out of that world
Get out of that world
1 second, and take a good look around our paradise
And don't ask for directions, because everyone is lost <|endoftext|> 
Oh here we go again
But not without a struggle
Oh there I fall again
While I promised myself

refr .:
    To stay on the right path
    Is more difficult than I thought
    Be careful with this brittle heart
    Soon it will break again before it bursts
    Soon it will break again before it bursts

Oh I feel it again
Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth
Oh I kiss you again
It must be because of the booze



refr.

And for everyone who knows everything for sure
And for all with their pomp and circumstance
And for all those days with a hangover
I embrace you my beloved mistress
And shout from the rooftops
No love isn't that bad yet
No love isn't that bad yet

Oh I see it again
I am certainly still not blind
oh i'm doing it again
I sometimes feel just like a child

refr. <|endoftext|> 
This is the end of the night
And every hour lasts for days
At the start of the day
I know what you are going to ask
The hour of truth will soon come
Will I be strong enough

refr .:
    Don't give up or give in
    When it stops I want you to call me
    Don't give up don't give in
    Whatever everyone else does
    Tomorrow the world will be smiling at me again



Drink your glass
And don't talk about the past
Soon in the hour of truth
Will I be strong enough

Yesterday I changed my mind
That my thoughts
Going out to you less and tomorrow
I will see you again
We were young and inexperienced
The future was bigger
Then the past
Do you sometimes think?
At that time

The memory of you
Was so precious, so long
We shared life
Through love
Divided by love

I see blurred images of you
In distant lands
And never on that island
Change will
You remained a stranger here
You stayed out here
Was it given a chance
How would it have gone

Displaced, displaced
Aren't we all
Anyone who thinks
Anyone who feels
Ever we all are
Left home
But we shared life
By love divided by love

I wrote a song for you
You know how it goes
I left you to your own devices
Then it was too late



How long have you waited
In that palace of your dreams
Like a princess, but the prince
Had already said goodbye

Later I asked
For forgiveness
Later you said
It's better
Time heals all wounds
Time does not repent

The memory of you
Was so precious, so long
We shared life
Through love
Divided by love

Yesterday I changed my mind
If I saw you again tomorrow
I would tell you this

Or maybe not
Or actually not
Better not

Or I sing a song
Divided by love
Divided by love <|endoftext|> 
The sea goes on and on without a doubt
The most beautiful sound after yours
Then tonight we are sure
Wanted to go on forever

We are happy for what that is worth
On a picture of a beautiful day
Whatever may happen, hold this moment

And when evening falls today
We wonder is this the last day
And when the goodbyes greet us
Then teach me how to do it



The beach is slowly emptying
The sun is setting
It has been such a quiet day
Was it the silence or was it your eyes
Which suddenly gave me doubts

Whatever may happen
Hold this moment
Like a picture of a beautiful day
However it turns out
Think of me then

With your head or with your heart
With your mouth or with your hand
Do what you have to do
Do what you have to do <|endoftext|> 
It's out of this world
It is out of date
But your beauty
Stay with us forever

It's not just words
It's not without regrets
But your beauty
Stay with us forever



Is there anyone
Who knows what happened
Is there anyone
Who knows what is happening

It is not without words
It's not that I understand
But your beauty
Stay with us forever <|endoftext|> 
The sea continues to roar
No doubt
The most beautiful sound on that
After you
Then tonight we lay down
And surely
Wanted to go on forever

We are happy for some
That is worth it
On a picture of a beautiful day
Whatever may happen
Hold this moment

refr .:
    And when evening falls today
    We ask ourselves: is this
    The last day
    And when the goodbyes greet us
    Then teach me how to do that



The beach is slowly emptying
The sun is setting
It has been such a quiet day
Was it the silence or were it
it your eyes
Making me suddenly
got doubts

Whatever may happen
Hold this moment
Like a picture of a beautiful day
However it turns out.
Think of me then

I swim through the water
On a Sunday morning
In a summer at the end
From the twentieth century

Is there anyone who can know
What time will bring us
Is there anyone who knows

refr .:
    Everything was so clear last night
    Last night we discovered America
    The skyline of Manhatten

The Mecca of capital
With businessmen on a pilgrimage
And whores on credit card
And a postcard for the woman

In a summer at the end
From the twentieth century



I swim through the water
As if through time that seems liquid
A young man on the beach
Build a city of yellow sand

Is there anyone who can know
How long that city will exist
Is there anyone who knows

refr.

The city that never sleeps
Jungle of concrete and steel
Where there is no happiness without money
But oh so beautiful, so terribly untainted

In a summer at the end
From the twentieth century
In a summer at the end
From the twentieth century <|endoftext|> 
And now the flowers are red, it is suddenly seen.
And sometimes you just pass it by.
The feeling of joy from all that simplicity, the feeling of happiness.

And what happened, we leave behind.
There is no good, and there is no evil.



You encourage yourself, you let yourself go
Tomorrow there's another day.

A sea of ​​time
A sea of ​​abundance
A sea of ​​old love

A sea of ​​time
A sea of ​​abundance
A sea of ​​old love <|endoftext|> 
Ultimately are words
The mirrors of your thoughts
All your words
All your words

It is what you feel
It is what you feel
What after a long long journey
Left over, left over

Drunk together
Together
Drunk alone
Only
It went no further
It went no further

We know what we are doing
Old and wise enough
You would say
Do not you think
Do not you think
Do not you think



Behind closed doors
Is a presumption of light
A suspicion of light
You must be home
You must be waiting

And the other world
Lost its way
But it always was
Life seems so time-bound
Or have you lost time
Lost time

Sung together
Together
Only sung
Only
It went no further

Like lipstick
On the edge
On the edge of the glass
That which remains
Remains <|endoftext|> 
The beach is full of stones
Stones of happiness
Stones from distant lands
They never want to go back

On the way to Naples
And then to the buried city
Where Romans Lived
Long before Christ was born

Ercolano glows in the sun
We walk around in amazement
There are the baths
There was a child there
Until the volcano
Time stood still



Everything has had its time
The sun and the moon
Here I have loved you
Here I have hated love

Ercolano glows in the sun
We walk around in amazement
How long have we existed
How long to go
We also live at the foot of a volcano

Ercolano glows in the sun
We walk around in amazement
How long have we been around
How long to go
We live too
At the foot of a volcano <|endoftext|> 
I woke up last night
And heard your hoarse voice
You were eating at the table
It was already known then
You took care of her for so long
Every day again

I visited your hometown
Wanted to know where you came from
Followed the trail to the North
Close to that big city
1914 - 1996
A life in a century

Hear the waves rustle
At the Dromedary of Enkhuizen
A beacon on land
For the lost in the night
A harbor for the ships
Back from the seven seas

It was a sudden goodbye
On that bright Sunday morning

I am no longer a son
But cherish the child
In possession of so many words
Which I lose to the wind
The drawing of the Dromedary
The dream that is there

For all brothers and sisters
For all friends and acquaintances
For all lovers and mistresses
For all passers-by and admirers
For all soul mates and every drinking brother
For all benefactors and listeners

Hear the waves rustle
At the Dromedary of Enkhuizen
A beacon on land
For the lost in the night
A harbor for the ships
Back from the seven seas



I could be in love
What we share is love
For the language and the characters
You don't think about the soul

A little further on, an American is talking
About violence and shares
We can hear him here

And my love speaks to her friend
It is raining in Holland
This afternoon we made friends
We didn't even know the language

But with hands and feet
And an enchanting smile
Our hearts were captured

I hear music everywhere
That's why it's better when I sleep
And dream of quiet lands
Or from Holland, where there is a house

This is an invitation
You're welcome

You know where to find me
In 't Paleis with Frank
Next to Anita's bar
In the lower town

Maybe we'll sing a song <|endoftext|> 
I love so much what you see in me
and I'm glad you show it because that's not how I saw myself
I am so proud of a boy after his first kiss
oh what a woman can do

I love to be quiet as much as I am next to you
I am as proud of all the noise we dance as husband and wife
am much more so, am the man who can do everything
anything is possible because I am your man

you love the most beautiful eyes
but that's not what I'm talking about
i just want to be that man be the man that makes me feel
your body has all the beauty that's not what I'm talking about
anyway want to be the man the man who makes me feel



I love so much what you see in me
liked myself too but not as much as you like me yet
how sweet it can be the day you trust someone loves you just the same

suddenly a man who can be comforted never thought
was a man no one had ever expected behind his scenes
but am not afraid anymore I can do everything such a man
oh what a woman can do

you love the softest hair
but that's not what I'm talking about
I just wanna be that man be the man that makes you feel
your voice even if I was blind still not what I mean
anyway i want to see that man who makes you feel like
oh what a woman can do <|endoftext|> 
Take me in your cruel arms
Take me in your soft mouth
Use your cups like a squid
Your tentacles go around

Wallow like a pig in the mud
Sweat like an otter in a ditch
Know that this night will end again
As always in the gutter

refr .:
    Because we come from the animals
    And we will be animals
    In that indivisible moment
    From blissful blissful
    Ecstatic loneliness

Take me helpless
In your clammy spider web
I'll hang there like a fly
Until you have had enough



Feed me your frogspawn
Feed me your glory
And I'll keep going as long as you want
To the rhythm of eternity

refr.

Devoured by each other
The eel slides through the mud
And all the animals come together
At the last supper

Come on come on this is the end
Wave like a sea anemone
It will remain so beautiful, so beautiful
Suddenly I understand humanity

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors slack
Until their nightmares blare
About old Amsterdam
In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors drank
And so lame like a pennant
Go roaring in the docks

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailor is drowning
Full of beer and gram
When the morning dawns

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailor awakens
When the heat is on again
About Damrak and Dam

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors look
Pecking Zilv'ren herring
By the tail, out of control

And from hand to mouth
They hurl it their snaps
Because they will hit him
Like a cat in the mitt

And they stink of eel
In their coarse blue sweaters
And they stink of onions
With that they do their meal

And after that meal they get up
To button their pants
And then they start walking again
And it burps in their crop

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors start to spin
And pick up the girls
Belly to belly, nice and clammy



And they turn their waltz
Like a revolving sun
Thin and out of tune on the sound
From an accordion

And as red as a lobster
They gasp for some air
As if suddenly with a sigh
The music breaks down

And with an air of weight
They then argue with regret
Their Mokum girl again
Back to the light again

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors go to drink
And just drink and drink
And then drink one more time

Drinking on the luck
From a whore from the Red Light District
Or a Hamburg whore
Well, a good piece

Of a slut who is herself
And has bestowed its virtue
For a guilder or eleven
And then they are well drunk

And with their shaky bodies
Then they discharge their drink
Piss like I whine
On the infidelity of the women

In the city of Amsterdam
In the city of Amsterdam <|endoftext|> 
Is there anyone
Who doubts the sun
As always
Shining down on us this morning?
There is nobody there anyway
Who just like me believes that from now on
will never be rest again and that every day
Can be too much

And when the morning finally comes
Disguised as a black night
I feel with my eyes closed
In the cold morning light
How the world gets used to it
That you are no longer with me



Is there anyone
Who really knows how that goes
No one to you
If the morning betrays you?

And when the morning finally comes
Disguised as a black night
I feel with my eyes closed
In the cold morning light
How the world gets used to it
That you are no longer with me <|endoftext|> 
The city gate closed in the dark,
the tower strikes the last hour.
And red light sparks along the canals
like imitation hellfire.
The night watchman with his blind head
climbs along the bridges stiff and gray.
His call echoes in alleys and demolition,
the slow long-forgotten wise.

Twelve, one, I keep watch
the clock has struck.
It will be days again soon
and the night is cold.

His soft footstep in the park
that makes twin ghosts flee,
draws dragging through the dark green.
He smiles wisely and bittersweet.
A gray man is on the street
and sings his song of brandy.
When the night watchman passes him,
then he agrees to the chorus.

Twelve, one, I keep watch ...



Then heaven becomes porcelain,
the last red light goes out.
The whistle of the first train,
the night watchman shakes his brown head,
flee the sunlight in a pub
and leaning on his halberd
he drowns there early the day,
a dew of tears in his beard.

He can't live by day
he flies himself to pieces in the sun.
No man ever saw him differently
then like a great gray moth.

Twelve, one, I keep watch ... <|endoftext|> 
"Look for myself another day
Because this one is broken
Was weird from the start
He is very different from the other one was
You know all about it
You were in the middle of this yesterday

Oh, and when I woke up, you were gone
Day and I were alone
And even though I was up earlier
We couldn't go anywhere without you

"Look for myself another day
Because this one makes no sense
So much love just snatched away
Suppose I ever find a day that I don't
A day when I don't think about you
I hate the day I get it



Oh, but I'll be fine
And dude, you just help me with it
Because even if you left as an angel
You know, there are two more here
2x

But may this be the last time?
Let this be the last time
never again and never so small
This must be the last time

This must be the last time

Never again and never so small again

So I never really know where I stand
She picks me up and rams me hard
This house is a ship and we are both captain
But are you just a bit of fun away from the quay
Once you have left, the anchor will be dropped again

Sometimes argue about nothing, sometimes about everything
If you say yes, she will say no and vice versa
It is a new ship and you have to learn to sail together
But your sails are finally in the wind
Immediately changes course again

But received from my mother
So mine



I try my best but I never know where I stand
This house is a ship, and we are on the bridge together
I love her, I hate and she hates me a lot too
But you have a nice view of the sea
You can see the harbor again

And then she screams and then she stops
And I shout and shut up at her
Anyway, we're breaking up today

CD from you, CD from me

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors slack
Until their nightmares blare
About old Amsterdam
In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors drank
And so lame like a pennant
Go roaring in the docks

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailor is drowning
Full of beer and gram
When the morning dawns

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailor awakens
When the heat is on again
About Damrak and Dam

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors look
Pecking Zilv'ren herring
By the tail, out of control

And from hand to mouth
They hurl it their snaps
Because they will hit him
Like a cat in the mitt

And they stink of eel
In their coarse blue sweaters
And they stink of onions
With that they do their meal

And after that meal they get up
To button their pants
And then they start walking again
And it burps in their crop

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors start to spin
And pick up the girls
Belly to belly, nice and clammy



And they turn their waltz
Like a revolving sun
Thin and out of tune on the sound
From an accordion

And as red as a lobster
They gasp for some air
As if suddenly with a sigh
The music breaks down

And with an air of weight
They then argue with regret
Their Mokum girl again
Back to the light again

In the city of Amsterdam
Where the sailors go to drink
And just drink and drink
And then drink one more time

Drinking on the luck
From a whore from the Red Light District
Or a Hamburg whore
Well, a good piece

Of a slut who is herself
And has bestowed its virtue
For a guilder or eleven
And then they are well drunk

And with their shaky bodies
Then they discharge their drink
Piss like I whine
On the infidelity of the women

In the city of Amsterdam
In the city of Amsterdam <|endoftext|> 
Hey Hello!
Look at me see the grass grow.
And everyone thinks I'm doing nothing
But nothing could be further from the truth.
Because even if I am not ready.
I'm tired of playing with the Beatles and neighbors.

Hey Hello!
Look at me the clouds break
Lying on my back here in the grass.
Reports, but more precisely,
The lucky loser.
What a game with the Beatles and the neighbors was.

 [With Background. ]
Everything should be more separate than separate.
Everything has to be special and everything has to be done again.
everything must be more unique than unique.
everything must be more special than anything that has long been special.



what the beatles and neighbors were.

La la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la

And for the rest you have to be with the Beatles and the neighbors! <|endoftext|> 
Sitting by the window
I look at all those beautiful people
They go out
They are going home
You do not know
As slow as it rains
The lovers do nothing
Don't let anyone tell them it's pouring
But the ones who go alone
Hiding in their coat
Those who go because they have to be somewhere
They color better with the songs the bartender plays for us
Quiet, like the sixth glass of wine
A woman stops at the window
Seems like she wants me to say something
It should be called Brussels here
I was finally gone

Sitting by the window
I look at all those beautiful people
And now and then they looked back
But more often not
Inside the coats go on
Empty the glasses
The people are standing
We are even twenty-one guilders



And I go with those who go alone
Tucked into my jacket
Nobody sleeps
The lonely one who smiles
I'm going left because I have to go right
And we're not going home yet
I play little Brussels tonight

There is a lady at the window
Seems like she wants me to say something
It should be called Brussels here
Then I was finally gone <|endoftext|> 
Like it goes in a movie
I saw her walking down the street
And the picture went black
There was a place name and a time
And she walked on in slow motion
But now as twenty years earlier
A little blond girl without a coat
Because it was always summer

And in that warm afternoon sun
As if it just won a main prize
A silent little fellow stepped along
I didn't have the words then

She was in charge as she said;
'I am a month older than you'
I thought it was fine as long as I was allowed
What you haven't bought with pocket money

be with her

I saw the summers and enjoyed it
And in the movie we grew up
Watch us bicycles, big school
And the music changes with it



She became more and more beautiful, a princess
I stayed the same, twice six
Watch us walk through the hallways
I the peace, she the longing

This could have been the end
She went looking, I came along
Until the school party, class 3b

Watch it begin, everything is fine
See me looking again, can't do anything
And right next to her one Jeroen

Be with her

A film that ends without end
She looks at me, recognized me
But no idea who I am anymore

Be with her <|endoftext|> 
So I never really know where I stand
She picks me up and rams me hard
It's like a ship and we're both captain
Are you just a bit of fun away from the quay
Are you gone, the anchor is already gone

Sometimes argue about nothing, sometimes about everything
If you say 'yes', she will say 'no' and vice versa
It's a new ship and you have to learn to sail together
But your sails are finally in the wind (you'll see)
Immediately changes course again

And then she screams and then she stops
And I shout and shut up at her
Anyway, we're breaking up today



CD of yours, CD of mine
CD from both of us
But received from my mother
From my mother so from me

I try my best, but I never know where I stand
This house, a ship and we are on the bridge together
I love her, I hate 'there
She hates me a lot too
But do you just have a nice view of the sea (and guess what)
You can see the harbor again
And then she screams and then she stops
And I shout and shut up at her
Anyway, we're breaking up today

CD of yours, CD of mine
CD from both of us
But received from my mother
From my mother so from me

therefore mine, therefore mine, therefore mine, therefore mine, therefore mine <|endoftext|> 
In front of the window, I sit alone for hours
I'll spell your name through the showers
All hope in me, which has already vanished
The moment I miss you so much here

I'm pausing time tonight
To think of you
How you smile every day, every night
Those beautiful moments
Can't go back to the time
Where I lived a life with you around me
So never alone again

I'm pausing time tonight
To hear from you
How you see it, you want to continue or not
Or am I lost?
I can't go back to you
Without doing things
That you hate about me
Or is it too late?

In my bed, I lie alone for hours
But I hear your voice right through everything
To the good years I have known
This moment when you are no longer here



I'm pausing time tonight
To think of you
How you smile every day, every night
Those beautiful moments
Can't go back to the time
Where I lived a life with you around me
So never alone again

I'm pausing time tonight
To hear from you
How you see it, you want to continue or not
Or am I lost?
I can't go back to you
Without doing things
That you hate about me
Or is it too late?

In front of the window, I sit alone for hours
I'll spell your name through the showers
All hope in me, which has already vanished
The moment I miss you so much here <|endoftext|> 
She walks she lags
she dances she stops
she gives she takes
she shares them kicks
she wraps you up
she pushes you away
she's pulling you out of your coat
and put you in like you were a kid
and would be sick from school

She talks she whispers
she sings she stops
she dances she snorts
she drinks she kicks
she flutters away
she lets you go
she knocks on your door by then
like she never really left
could never be gone

And when she smiles
the world laughs along with her
when she cries, she cries the sea
when she's silent, she's silent the moon
and if she will love you
if she loved you you would die
that would destroy you



She kisses, she kisses
she kisses, she stops
she goes, she comes
she comes, she stops
she repels you
she attracts you
she beats you in extra time
like you weren't even participating
you would never be good enough

You give, you take
you stop, she laughs
you go you disturb
you turn, she laughs
you're out
you smile at her
she laughs at you or at you or back
you know you won't get away
never really left

And when she smiles, the world smiles with her
when she cries, she cries the sea
when she's silent, she's silent the moon
and if she will love you
if she loved you you would die
that would destroy you

And no one can save her
and no one is allowed
and no one will know
only us, only us, only us <|endoftext|> 
As long as I don't have to get out of here.
as long as I may exist here.
as long as your smile is meant for me.
you leave everything else alone, there really couldn't be better.

We don't have to plan.
It doesn't matter what you do.
Because life dances its own dance. and pretty good in her way.
And what must be done.

Chorus:
Everything passes, but first we enjoy it, first we enjoy it.
Everything passes, but first we happily enjoy, we enjoy it.

Whole days are lost.
To the fight against time.
That had already won long before you started.
So drop that fight anyway.
Who wins from eternity?

Let's live what we can.
It's the only thing that can.
And we don't look too far ahead.
And what goes wrong, too bad.
Just enjoy it.



Chorus:
Everything passes, but first we enjoy it, first we enjoy it.
Everything passes, but first we enjoy it away happy, we enjoy it.

As fame came here.
Does it also blow past again.
And so love will disappear again.
My love, my friends, stay with me, closer. Even closer.

Sing while the song continues, and we dance, and we kiss, and we laugh at each other.
And we'll get drunk tonight
Don't think about the hangover, enjoy, just enjoy.

Chorus:
Everything passes, but first we enjoy it, first we enjoy it. Everything passes, but happy first, we enjoy it.
But first we enjoy it, we enjoy it.
Everything passes, but first we happily enjoy, we enjoy it.


XxX Danielle. <|endoftext|> 
I've known you for a day or two now
Never want to miss you now
Suddenly realize that it is now about to start
And I secretly wonder
What I would do if you died
Or find someone else or just leave me
And immediately I am jealous
And think terrible things
Who come now because I love you so
Why can't I just be here
Without getting lost
Why can't I just be here with you

And then I can not resist
With no army to conquer
I gently get out of bed and grab a beer
And while I watch you
How you sleep in our bed
I cry those two lines on paper

If you leave me
If you leave me
Can I come with you?



If you leave me
Can I come with you then?
Can I come with you then? <|endoftext|> 
If you see me tomorrow
Will you know what I feel
Will you say your beautiful friends
Look, that's that cute guy I'm talking about
Or sometimes you don't know what I dream every night
And you only see a madman
Who smiles at you very scary

If you see me tomorrow



If you see me tomorrow
And I finally tell you
How long I've wanted you and I've been waiting
Do you listen
Are you smiling at me
Or do I scare you
Never pass you by again

Better to only long for you
Then to tell what it is like, to long for you

Maybe it is better not to have something
Then to get rid of it right away
Why should I forfeit what I don't have and cherish for something that cannot be true
If you see me tomorrow
If you see me tomorrow <|endoftext|> 
I never really know where I stand
She picks me up and rams me hard

Without thinking.
This is my goal.
You make me feel so familiar.
I need to talk to you.
I speak to you.
Feel the sparks fly.

I'll take you
to the sunset.
Together by the sea,
all night long.

Through the beautiful streets of Athens,
I walk hand in hand with you here by my side.
For the dream trip of my life,
I've given up everything
to be here alone with you tonight.

Through the beautiful streets of Athens,
where everyone always smiles happily at you.
I experience so many adventures,
I love working overtime
and all in that one Greek night.



It's very special.
Exactly on time.
Out of nowhere I am delighted.
"I'm overwhelmed by romance.
The two of us with roses and music.

I'll take you
to the sunset.
Together by the sea,
all night long.

Through the beautiful streets of Athens,
I walk hand in hand with you here by my side.
For the dream trip of my life,
I've given up everything
to be here alone with you tonight.

Every Wednesday,
I'm waiting for three o'clock to strike,
Class over, goodbye teacher,
Full of games with all the children
It's spring, spring,
spring

With Catherine on the swing,
Little Bernard on the trampoline
And we sing in
chorus this simple melody
This is life, this is life, this is life

Catherine, Catherine, Catherine
With your beautiful eyes
Catherine, Catherine, Catherine
With you I am happy



A lemonade, an ice cream cone
In the cool shade of a beautiful terrace
It's a holiday with all my friends
Let's go, let's go, let's go

Without my father or my mother
To watch me
It's the party, the real party,
she can start <|endoftext|> 
Your shadow keeps following me
Your arrows are aimed
I feel you are here somewhere
But always out of sight

Why are you so busy
With that little life of mine
You want like in a fairytale
A princess by my side

Yet there is not one that extinguishes all my love fires

Oh Cupid, just leave me alone

In the spring, in the summer,
autumn and winter
Do you know where to find me
wherever I go

In the spring, the summer,
autumn and winter
Do you know where to find me
looking for a girl for me

You don't have to help me
If I don't ask you for it
Yet you don't seem to be listening
On days like today



Trying to show me the way
To the treasure I don't find
Will the one ever catch me?
If amore blinded me

Yet there is not one that extinguishes all my love fires

Oh Cupid, just leave me alone

In the spring, the summer,
autumn and winter
Do you know where to find me
wherever I go
In the spring, in the summer,
autumn and winter
Do you know where to find me
looking for a girl for me

Yet there is not one that extinguishes all my love fires

Oh Cupid, just leave me alone

In the spring, in the summer,
autumn and winter
Do you know where to find me
wherever I go
In the spring, in the summer,
autumn and winter
Do you know where to find me
looking for a girl for me <|endoftext|> 
Every day is like the same day.
The alarm clock rings in the morning.
You listen to the radio
a vague morning show awakens you.

A bird is whistling, you have to get out the door again.
On the way to school or at work.
Suddenly a girl laughs happily,
you shrug, she passes

But then you follow her legs
And watch as long as you can watch.
From her head to her toes,
she is every man's dream.
Yes, then you follow her legs
And watch as long as you can watch
From her head to her toes,
she is every man's wildest dream.



Every smile you saw for this one
wasn't as sweet as hers.
She seems like a very ordinary girl
the neatly asks you to step aside.

But then you follow her legs.
And watch as long as you can watch.
From her head to her toes,
she is every man's dream.
Yes, then you follow her legs.
And watch as long as you can watch.
From her head to her toes,
she is every man's wildest dream.

From her head to her toes,
she is every man's wildest dream. <|endoftext|> 
Boom Boom Bailando,
dance the tango with me.
Boom Boom Bailando,
dance with me tonight.
It's like playing with my legs
I float when you smile at me.
Boom Boom Bailando,
dance the tango with me.
Boom Boom Bailando,
you control me.
Senorita for you I put everything aside,
I've been waiting for you for so long.

A dance like tango has its own language,
life is no longer so quiet.
Every movement has its own story,
tell me as much as you want.
Yes the passion, the rhythm, the charm, the lust,
the tango has everything in one.


And if you're the one to kiss me then
I don't feel so alone anymore.



Boom Boom Bailando,
dance the tango with me.
Boom Boom Bailando,
dance with me tonight.
It's like playing with my legs
I float when you smile at me.
Boom Boom Bailando,
dance the tango with me.
Boom Boom Bailando,
you control me.
Senorita for you I put everything aside,
I've been waiting for you for so long.

I live in a world of dance and music
silence is unknown to me.
It's a party all day long cause you see
I'm not used to it any other way.
Yes, that passion, your body of the mane of wine, someone who stops me.
By dancing you passed in my life,
yes you with your heart of gold.

Boom Boom Bailando,
dance the tango with me.
Boom Boom Bailando,
dance with me tonight.
It's like playing with my legs
I float when you smile at me.
Boom Boom Bailando,
dance the tango with me.
Boom Boom Bailando,
you control me.
Senorita for you I put everything aside,
I've been waiting for you for so long. <|endoftext|> 
Every night before I go to sleep
Even if I am so tired
I crawl close to you for a moment
To feel what my blood is flowing for
And my heart beats faster
To be with whom my love belongs

I wouldn't trade you for gold
Without you I would cry every day
Because you are at home our sun in the house
Which spreads its rays everywhere
I wouldn't trade you for gold
Sometimes I can hide behind you
Because you are ready, you are always there
Where you are needed
For me

Every morning before the alarm rings
I have long awakened
I already woke you up
To say that you are more beautiful than the most beautiful melody
That my heart only belongs to you



I wouldn't trade you for gold
Without you I would cry every day
Because you are at home our sun in the house
Which spreads its rays everywhere
I wouldn't trade you for gold
Sometimes I can hide behind you
Because you are ready, you are always there
Where you are needed
For me

One day when we are much older together than we are now
I know you will be there for me always

I wouldn't trade you for gold
Without you I would cry every day
Because you are at home our sun in the house
Which spreads its rays everywhere
I wouldn't trade you for gold
Sometimes I can hide behind you
Because you are ready, you are always there
Where you are needed
For me <|endoftext|> 
I can't control myself now that I look at you like that
And thinking that I am or seem drunk
I'm in a different world
I really don't look anymore and I watch you dance with everyone
My friends aren't getting any better, I prefer to go right away
Colors in your hair, but I'm not going home without you.

Oh what will I show you
The corners of the room,
Where you let me float
Will give you everything
And it might seem to you in bed
Still a bit more pleasant,
Tonight or early in the morning,
I can never get enough of you.

We stroll down the street, I laugh at how you say what he said
I pull you close and feel proud, you are mine
Baby you might have the key
Throw your clothes on the floor like I do.



Oh what will I show you
The corners of the room,
Where you let me float
Will give you everything
And it might seem to you in bed
Still a bit more pleasant,
Tonight or early in the morning,
I can never get enough of you.

No one as beautiful as you
No one who understands me better
No one who likes to knock back a beer glass so much
But you are capable of that

So!
Oh what will I show you
The corners of the room,
Where you let me float
Will give you everything
And it might seem to you in bed
Still a bit more pleasant,
Tonight or early in the morning,
At your home or in the pub,
I can never get enough of you. <|endoftext|> 
Always You

Tapping on the windows
You don't see anyone outside
I let out a big sigh
It is pouring out of the sky

Roads full of water
That's why I'm late
A bit wet
So can take a bath with you right away

Chorus:
But even the rain
Don't stop me
On the long way home
I'll be home for a little while
To caress you
To share the night
Those thoughts make me happy
There is one and it is always you

Almost every day
I kept asking you
This time with me
That's why I'm driving to you



Without all that water
I wasn't there later
Certainly not that wet
Can now take a bath with you right away

Chorus:
But even the rain
Don't stop me
On the long way home
I'll be home for a little while
To caress you
To share the night
Those thoughts make me happy
There is one and it is always you

You are the dream for me
That starts over and over again
One day it will come out like me
Find the one in you

Chorus:
But even the rain
Don't stop me
On the long way home
I'll be home for a little while
To caress you
To share the night
Those thoughts make me happy
There is one and it is always you <|endoftext|> 
Hold on to you in this life
Hold on to you from now on
You who have given me so much
However, you who saw me

I crawl into you
Towards your beauty
You believe in me in abundance

When you are with me, I am happy
I feel free
forget the time
When you are with me and look at me
After a long day, lovingly made love to me again

Love me love my in this life
Love me my love from now on
I, who can give you so much
Me who will be behind you



You crawl into me
Into the night again
I believe in everything you do

When you are with me, I am happy
I feel free
forget the time
When you are with me and look at me
After a long day, make love to me again

Hold on to you in this life <|endoftext|> 
It already seemed summer
Yet it was not until the end of May
A day that you think will never pass
Friends came by
But I just wanted
Walking on the beach just nowhere

Then I saw you
You called me with your eyes
I looked at you
And got a strange feeling
Because I understood
What you wanted to ask me
Come closer to me

I was 16 and you were 28
And I didn't know much about love yet
But I understood what you wanted to say to me
I was no longer a child
And it came summer (summer)

You were so free, I thought it was a bit weird at first
You wore nothing but your long blonde hair
I was shy and didn't know what to do
I just stood there looking oh how green I felt



"I understand" I hear you say
You're so young
Don't know what to do
Don't worry one night will teach you
Come closer to me

We continued walking along the beach together
And like a boy I took your hand
But as a man, I saw the sun rise again
And it was summer
Summer came (summer)

Summer was coming
For "it all in my life."
Summer was the very first time
I was a man when the sun came up
And it was summer
It just stayed summer forever <|endoftext|> 
Verse 1:

I had such a beautiful dream last night
I was sitting on a cloud very high and soft.
All planets around me
and the moon that shined beautifully.
I saw the earth beneath me
and all people were free.
Nowhere did I see jealousy
there was perfect harmony.
And every child from pole to pole
could go to a nice school for free.
Plenty of food for everyone
no one felt alone.
Nor did I see rich or poor here
so simple everyone equal.
Nobody looked at rank or rank
all people hand in hand.

Chorus:

If I could be a wizard
I created a world without pain.
Then love was ideal
everyone spoke the same language.
If I were a wizard
I created a world without pain.
every person was good and wise
we lived in paradise

Verse 2:



Suppose this dream was a reality
then no one was envied anymore.
And nature was never upset
the sun that shone every day.
Which was the most beautiful
no one looked at color or race.
No human or animal was in need anymore
nothing or nobody died anymore.

Chorus:

If I could be a wizard
I created a world without pain.
Then love was ideal
everyone spoke the same language.
If I were a wizard
I created a world without pain.
every person was good and wise
we lived in paradise.

If I were a wizard
I created a world without pain.
every person was good and wise
we lived in paradise. <|endoftext|> 
I'm broken in my bed
Just turned off the shower
I wanted to but it didn't really work
My hangover won the fight again, lost to the bottle again
and in addition..
nobody wants to see me like that
Was talking in the cafe
Some friends with me
I didn't see you but you arrived
And immediately went close to me
You released all brakes
Nice time, but now I've lost it

Chorus:
When the morning has come
And everything I've been through is long gone
When the morning has come
You leave my past and you are the one I miss

I was so glad you were there
Only you kept filling my glass
The lights on, my light off
The last lap to conclude
It was at the end of the day
But for me, it was long gone



Chorus:
When the morning has come
And everything I've been through is long gone
When the morning has come
You leave my past and you are the one I miss

Hope this never happens to me again
It's already too late, but don't worry
I learned from what you did to me

Chorus
When the morning has come
And everything I've been through is long gone
When the morning has come
You leave my past and you are the one I miss <|endoftext|> 
I only had 1 minute with you
In which I would ask everything again
Because since you're gone
I long for every moment
But if only for 1 minute with you

I only had 1 minute with you
In which I would thank you again
Even if I had done something stupid
You stayed behind me
I only had 1 minute with you

I only had 1 minute with you
To hear what you think
If I don't know for a moment
When I have doubts about things, I see you
One look or a gesture
Our discussions with each other
If only you were here for a while
Then I would bombard you with everything and more
Embracing yourself firmly again…. the very last time
Just a minute
Just for a moment

I only had 1 minute with you
In which I would tell you again
That there is no more day for me
Without missing you
I only had 1 minute with you



I only had 1 minute with you
To hear what you think
If I don't know for a moment
When I have doubts about things I see you
One look or a gesture
Our discussions with each other
If only you were here for a while
Then I would bombard you with everything and more
Embracing you firmly again for the very last time
Just a minute
Just for a moment

I only had 1 minute with you
To hear what you think
If I don't know for a moment
When I have doubts about things I see you
One look or a gesture
Our discussions with each other
If only you were here for a while <|endoftext|> 
The pastor of Amersfoort
who killed his first wife,
the second he also throated
and the third was bored to death.
Only with number four
it went from tierelierelier.
Fabriapadapadapam.

The pastor and number four
have great fun
Their life is just fun
they lie in bed day and night.
Except one day a week,
then the pastor delivers his sermon.
Fabriapadapadapam.

On Sunday the pastor says:
so we go to rat mode.
Our life is only sin,
if only we could let it go
and devoutly he looks at the cross
and then he thinks about home again.
Fabriapadapadapam.



And when he got home, his wife whispers:
forget it all soon
you don't even know if God exists
and you're not hurt at all.
Come here now
then we go from tierelierelier.
Fabriapadapadapam.

But on a beautiful day in May
then that sinful minister died.
And the whole village was in mourning
and what you wouldn't think like that:
he got into paradise
and found all three of his wives.

Unfortunately number four was still missing,
it went from tierelierelier
with the president of the church director. <|endoftext|> 
I put my hands around the railing
The coast disappears, the boat drifts
I feel a peaceful kind of boredom
I can but I don't know if I want to
In the distance I can still vaguely see the land
A little sand, a little rock
I wave my hand again, right
I know: There is no human being, I am alone

Goodbye, goodbye
Maybe goodbye
It may take a while before I get back



refr .:
    They ask me at the captain's table
    I want refuse that simple life
    I feel a little bit unstable
    What course the captain tuesd tonight

Goodbye, goodbye
Maybe goodbye
It may take a while before I get back

The night is endless
the road is a cave
with green dripstone trees.
I spare the wind that I catch
to whistle, I scoff
with all my sad dreams.

My car rides on like a pumpkin,
the prince is on the road tonight.
He has holes in his socks
and a glass shoe
and his boots lent to the cat.
And whizzing under the hood
in a treadmill six white mice.

Cinderella ... Don't forget the eggs.
Cinderella ... One and a half ounces of savage sausage.
Cinderella ... Lobster with baked fruit.
Cinderella ... Shark fin soup again.

And there is a man riding for me
with his head in his hat
who really can't drive.
I bet I can
I can do it twice as well
I'll cut it in a minute.



The lighthouse keeper descends to the beach,
his daughter sinks in her tree.
The lions rule with an iron hand.
I hide my face in my dream.
I feel insecure inside.
It's time to come up with a ruse.

Cinderella ... Making bed.
Cinderella ... Clean sheets.
Cinderella ... Curtains closed.
Cinderella ... Lights out.

And above the woods
the castle rises
conquered by Reinaert de Vos.
Speculaas with his servant
on the roof of cinnamon
throws off the bars of candy.
Then I immediately dive into my feathers
to teach the chill to carve.

Aaahhh, aaahhh.
Cinderella ... Yes.
Cinderella ... Ooh.
Cinderella ... Fine, glitter.
Cinderella ... Hoepla.
Cinderella ... Cozy.
Cinderella. Cinderella. <|endoftext|> 
A hot shadow fell on the beach,
that depression had caught the sun after all.
The wind stayed under the cloud cover.
The day stopped between one and two.

Vanilla ice melted in her brown hand,
she licked slowly with a cool desire.
She still had salty pearls on her cheeks,
she brought the waves in her hair.

And in her eyes the stars of the sea.
In her shell of silence I looked for holes,
tried to get me to talk to her.
I looked up and had no idea.

Four digits formed an advertising flight.
Then there was eau-de-cologne in the air.

She said something I could hardly understand
a man was playing with a radio
who could then share with me in four voices
that love was all I needed.

A while later she looked at me thoughtfully
and just when I wanted to caress her shoulder,
she was apparently getting bored
that I just sat silently next to her.



And she half disappeared behind the morning paper,
world news could be read up to her navel.
She said cologne would be nice.
I was sorry I didn't have that with me.

She looked brown under her bikini,
she had a high fence around her garden.

The first drops fell on my hand,
time for tea and to get dressed.
Suddenly everything seemed like years ago
she put on her clothes and greeted me.

A veil of rain fell over the beach
and children cried loudly and discontented.
The wet flags dropped
and something that never started was already over.

Her small cruel hand did not release me.
The rain made me long for the sea again,
her waves held me captive again.
I took the morning paper with me, it was mine.

More and more I was dragged away from the beach,
the scent of cologne wafted from the land. <|endoftext|> 
Your arms darling can't be turned
you must not make your hands into fists.
Your eyes don't have to be so hard
relax those hard lines around your jaw.
Your sweet body is soft to the touch.
But you only think of your own salvation
you only think about your own business
and that is beneath contempt.
Watch yourself and smile, your soft arm
was made for my head to rest on
your chest as a safe pillow keeps me warm,
but warmer are your lips that kissed me.
So one by one you awakened my other lusts.
But you thought of another in the meantime
with which you easily calm your conscience
and that is beneath contempt.



My love was the stake for your game,
you liked to let your vanity be caressed by me.
You didn't want to, then you wanted to.
I was blinded, I just let me play.
You just let someone else steal you
and my luck just got lost.
But you didn't really care about my grief
and that was beneath contempt.

You lie princely in a different bed
and makes him foolish and drunk with your body,
which in no way prevents you
behind his back to ogle me again.
Cheating is in your style,
you gave yourself to me in secret,
but it is still beneath contempt. <|endoftext|> 
Dutch Negro, you are from Suriname
Like we once came to Suriname from the Netherlands
When we see you walking here, we think: that man is cold
In a country where hardly any white person likes calypso
No one forbids us
But we don't sing your calypso

refr .:
    Oh oh pierement
    What do you think you are
    If you don't know the calypso
    It is related to the Netherlands



Dutch nigger, you cannot inspire us
We will never learn the rhythm of the calypso
The American Negro does get us in a daze
And American whites do sing the blues
No one forbids us
But we don't sing your calypso

I had never been to Berlin there
 You do not just go to Berlin
 And why should I suddenly be there
 I've never been to Berlin

I knew Berlin from my father
 He often told about his time in Berlin
 The city of long ago
 Strange that I know so many fathers
 All of which agree in Berlin
 Did some things

Berlin, those were great years
 Then everything revolved around Berlin
 Berlin where they danced
 Tango with tea
 Foxtrot at dinner
 And later in the dance café
 Berlin where you had friends
 Unter den linden
 Berlin was the most beautiful city

I had never been to Berlin there
 But I sometimes dream that I am somewhere
 On a street I don't know about
 And yet knows where I am




There is always hanging over that city
 A strange haze of soot
 As if there had been a fire somewhere recently
 And here and there the past sticks like blood
 And does not want time to pass
 In streets that no longer exist
 Left by every hope
 And all the bullet holes in the world
 Sit in line

In the middle of the city
 The skeleton of a church
 Bombed into a monument
 As if that is necessary in this city
 Which is eternally consumed by war

Oh Berlin, those were good years
 Then everything revolved around Berlin
 Berlin where they danced
 Tango with tea
 Foxtrot at dinner
 And later in the dance café
 Berlin where you had friends
 Unter den linden
 Berlin was the most beautiful city <|endoftext|> 
Now you never have to put on your coat again
and hope your light does it.
Let the storm wind rage in the dark outside
for inside it is warm and light and good.
Look outside hand in hand where the rain falls.
I see the fire of hope and doubt in your eyes
and I know your deepest fear.

Because you can't know for sure and everything will pass.
But I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe in you and me.

And when you get up in the morning, I'll be with you
and maybe I've already made some tea.
And when the sun is shining outside we will walk through the dunes
and when it rains we go back to bed.
Waking up slowly for hours, floating through time,
I see the light through the curtains and I know:
the past provides no certainty.



Because you can't know for sure ...

I turn off the lights and the room is getting dark now
a street lamp outside gives some light.
And the things in the room become friends who go to sleep
the chairs are waiting for breakfast.
And tomorrow I wake up to the scent of bread and honey
the shine of the golden sunlight in your hair.
And the things in the room, I say goodnight
tonight we'll go to sleep and we'll see tomorrow.

But things in the room would be lifeless things without you.
And you can't know for sure, because everything will pass.
But I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe in you and me.
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe in you and me.

And you can't be sure ... <|endoftext|> 
As a boy I stole their fruit
then I got kicked in front of my ass.
Then I was called an arch-scoundrel
because I was on their daughter.
The reputation I had
has been on the street just like me for a long time.
They know me in this town
it is better that I leave her.

My parents are still with me
I ignore their grief.
They live in my piggery.
And like my mother again one night
I didn't come home, waited,
then she whines and then I get angry
and curse and roar with all your might.
Better I leave her.

I found my love in this land
it was May all along the Spaarne.
Once our bed was the North Sea beach,
but otherwise I am silent, it is over.



Yet she always stays close to me,
I am unable to divorce.
So neither of us are free
it is better that I leave her.

Yes Prince, you said that right,
God is love, nothing else.
That is good, but I am bad
since who was dear to me left me
since who I was faithful betrayed me.
But I want love and not hate
so if life doesn't offer that,
it is better that I leave it.

Better I leave
better I leave it ... <|endoftext|> 
I would rather be at home than in a pub
But at night the silence creeps around me
And thinking about you I did enough
So I prefer to stay on my feet
Because sleeping is no longer alone

Alone is just alone, I know the city
Once I am awkward and fed up
Every body is equally warm and soft
And helps forget what I once had
That's how I know my friends from one night

When the day comes, I don't see my prey
There is an unfamiliar face sleeping next to me
And early in the morning she turns out not to be so beautiful anymore
Like last night with that pink light
Then I quickly close my eyes again



Maybe it was nice for this time
I will never come and go after this night
And when she meets me and smiles questioningly
Then I think: who are you again
That's how I know my friends from one night

Sometimes I half dream that I recognize something again
A scent of hers, a smile that I love
All too well I know where I am
Here I am with a strange naked woman
And nobody in the world looks like you

But if I stay at home in the evening, then it becomes quiet
Those rooms full from back then, they are so cold
I run into town and start hunting again
And bring myself again where I don't want to
That's how I know my friends from one night

Little princesses, if someone hurts you
Or mention sluts or sweat about morals
Let him get a sickness full of venom
We slept together and that was nice
And that's why I never despised anyone
But I will always be grateful to you
That's how I am, my one night friends <|endoftext|> 
Girls wait nights
on the god Shalomon Ra,
the dragon guards Ophelia
the one in the avenue of the iguanas
with jasmine under plane trees
thinks back to Antarctica.
Helion then rapes
before my eyes Ariadne.
Soft glaze is Babylon.

Temple gold shines brightly
in the rays of the sun.
There Helion rises reborn.
Interrupted by the gongs
tracks the sun in strips
up in front of the tongues gate.
Helion kills Oberon
before the eyes of Apollo.
Soft glaze is Babylon.

Priests lift horns
for the white stone god.
Elysee mourns fate.
When the army has fought,
masters have died
at the first spring festival.
Helion plays the bigot
before the eyes of Nemesis.
Soft glaze is Babylon.



Girls wait nights ...

Temple gold shines bright ... <|endoftext|> 
Do you want to dance, Rosalinde,
do you want to dance all night.
Come my dear, my dear,
I waited a long time for this.
Let me teach you love
let us wait no more because
tomorrow I have to march
for the dear homeland.
I have to march tomorrow
for the dear homeland.

But I don't dare to dance my love
the night is so dark and cold.
And I hear four riders riding
beyond through the dark forest.
They come on skinny horses,
they are in no hurry and no time.
Why did they come?
I don't want to lose my love there.

Let us laugh, Rosalinde,
there will be the wind in the chimney.
No one will find us both
drink the love and the wine.
No one will harm us both
fill the glass to the brim.
I have to march tomorrow
for the dear homeland.
I have to march tomorrow
for the dear homeland.

But do you hear those hooves out there
they drive across the country.
And behind the four horsemen
cities and towns are on fire.
Oh, if only I could keep you,
you stayed with me forever.
But I hear them coming closer
and I don't want to lose my love there.



Come my little Rosalinde,
there will be the storm in the trees.
After all, you are my beloved
clink and drink the red wine.
Make your locks and your clothes
let go and reach out your hand now.
I have to march tomorrow
for the dear homeland.
I have to march tomorrow
for the dear homeland.

Never again will I lie with you
the riders will not pass you by.
They come to get my love
or they came for me too.
It's getting daylight in the east,
my love, now is your time.
I hear four riders riding
and I don't want to lose my love there.

Hello my little Rosalinde,
I'll be thinking of you day and night.
Once I'll find you again
I know you'll be waiting for me then.
If I don't return sometimes
give someone other than your hand.
Now goodbye I have to march
for the dear homeland.
Now goodbye I have to march
for the dear homeland.

Prince God, why does he have to die?
Why is the world so cruel?
Where do riders come ridden,
four horsemen with war and suffering?
Why do you let me love him
if you do divorce us with this?
I have to carry a child of his
and I don't want to lose my love there. <|endoftext|> 
If you don't love me
Do I have to learn to live with that?
But the night is cold and the morning is far away
Don't go and stay a while

If you don't love me
Am I not the man of your dreams?
And even if you stay with me tonight
He will definitely come


If you don't love me
I love you alone
As beautiful when you smile
So warm and so soft

If you don't love me
I only love you
Stay with me this one night
And don't leave me alone




If you don't love me
Will you choose another
But what is not cannot be lost
So I can never lose you

Sometimes I think you were there before
Maybe before I knew you
Sometimes I think you always will
Even if I never saw you again


If you don't love me
I love you alone
As beautiful when you smile
So warm and so soft

If you don't love me
I only love you
Stay with me this one night
And don't leave me alone <|endoftext|> 
Her face can say anything
when she hurts my heart melts
the sun is breaking through in her eyes
when she's happy.

She knows how to refute my anger
with the innocence of a child
or resist with grace
which is irresistible.

We are always together
We are always one
We are always together



She is the last one I love
and the only one forever
if she goes away I will stay forever
in solitude.

Sometimes when I'm away, on long journeys
I miss her warmth around me
without her there is emptiness
of alone.

We are always together
We are always one
We are always together <|endoftext|> 
Do you notice that the sun is shining brighter?
when the smoke clears from your head.
Do you notice that the wind blows harder?
if you oppose him instead of with it.
It's cooler in the house than by the sea
when the smoke clears from your head.

You carve your name in the grain of a tree
and no one ever knows who you are.
The ranger smiles when he recognizes you,
you drift slowly with the flow
when the smoke clears from your head.
When the smoke clears from your head.

When a call is received, you leave the building
and you walk down the stairs.
The tram conductor in front of the door on the sidewalk
nods silently but very politely.
You want to say something, but you are much too tired
because you come down the stairs.



You darken the sun with the wind at your back
the tram conductor shakes his head.
Today there is no one left to believe
his cane for the blind taps on the bridge.
When the smoke clears from your head.
When the smoke clears from your head.

Do you notice that the day is longer?
when the smoke clears from your head.
Do you notice that the night is warmer?
when the mist weighs down your eyes,
the candle you stare at together
when the smoke clears from your head.

The clock and clapper move the time,
you slide into a snow-deep hole.
They ask for the morning, you give it in return
for the egg you eat for breakfast.
When the smoke clears from your head.
When the smoke clears from your head.

When the smoke clears from your head
When the smoke clears from your head <|endoftext|> 
Oh I feel like a different person
Close my eyes and make a wish
That you're sitting here next to me now
Because I still adore you
But I know you'll be here later
The sun is shining, so we drink beer
Although there are many people around me
But for me there is only one

    I have summer on my mind
    All terraces are full again
    The beach is littered with people
    What is there to wish for
    Now the fun really starts for me



Get out of the rut for a while
Just a laugh, no nagging
I enjoy the warm sun
It's like a yellow hot air balloon
An old man is sitting at the table
Who can no longer run from the drink
Nobody says anything
He doesn't get in anyone's way

In the park, in the city
I buy ice cream and chips
Then I enjoy a laugh
Sunday is a short day
In the small patch of forest
Just a dieffie-with-deliver
Because the day passes so quickly
Soon they will go back home
Don't ask me how I feel
In the evening in that strange chair
In that room, so alone
In that mess around me
That's what I long for them so much
Which I am a part of anyway
It's just for a while, we're back together



Sunday, at ten o'clock
Then I can see the children
That's all that's left for me
After the letter you wrote me yesterday
Oh, Sunday, at ten o'clock
Then I can see the children
Every day is too long for me
But Sunday will pass quickly

There was no end and no beginning when Aeneas was born
And now that I'm looking, the bells in the tower are striking
The story, for those who want to hear it, of an endless journey

A man is sweeping up shards and laying tombstones in the ground
I'm walking through this death threat because our house used to be here
But I am strange and unhealthy on an endless journey



I may arrive at a station expected by cross-eyed beggars
The last train meets the sun, the evening falls frighteningly soft
And I am strange and without strength on an endless journey

And when I ask where I am now, people stare behind collars
There are pavements far away from them, no one answers my questions
Because I am strange and have been on an endless journey for many days

And if someone is expecting me, I'll come back and it will turn out
It was never the way I thought it was and it never will be
It's strange to settle down after an endless journey <|endoftext|> 
I was lucky when I look back to my childhood
Because I am what so many want to be
But remember the sun didn't always shine
My audience made it shine anyway
I was lucky I just came off the street
What I am now I needed you for
It's nice when someone loves you
Must never be different again
I need you

You have been behind me for 15 years
You always made me happy
I want to sing for you
But you must know
I wouldn't have been here without you
Who knows what I would have done
Without my fans

I was lucky to understand everyone
Rich or poor, they came to have a look anyway
But understand it keeps doing me good
Never let it be, I need you
I was lucky, I just came off the street
What I am now I needed you for
It's nice when someone loves you
It should never be any different
I need you



You have been behind me for 15 years
You always made me happy
I want to sing for you
You need to know
I wouldn't have been here without you
Who knows what I would have done
Without my fans

It's so nice when someone loves you
May never be different, I need you

You have been behind me for 15 years
You always made me happy
I want to sing for you
You need to know
I wouldn't have been here without you
Who knows what I would have done
Without my fans

A staircase, a door and behind that door there I have to be.
I knew you were home, but I was starting to fear the worst.
Because you were not alone, his image went through me.
Yes, now I know why you disappeared so quickly.

I never meant it that way.
No, I never felt that way.
No, I didn't expect it like that.
Another in your house, sharing with you all night.

I never meant it that way
No, I never felt that way
No, I didn't expect it like that
I beg you, send him away, I want to be with you all night

I'll listen at your door and know he's drinking my whiskey.
And you, you drink wine, you thought that was so pleasant at the sound.
But you said that to me, oh is that over now
Tonight there is another one by your side.

Leonardo lives upstairs in a tower,
builds birds of wood and parchment.
He lets them fly out the window
and sees them fall and searches
to the secret that no one knows.

Leonardo, he believes what he does
he believes it must.
The people will fly,
the people will be free.

Nobody likes Leonardo,
Leonardo doesn't love anyone.



Full of superstition and inbreeding
under brown felt hats
the town folk huddle together.
Leonardo is a wizard.

When night falls
and i feel tired and despondent
I look at the sea
and I see the waves endlessly.
And I see the water alive
the gold from the horizon
washes with the waves.

Leave the water open
leave the water open,
leave the water open
and let the sea be the sea.

When the water goes down
and the land rises again,
you linger along the dike,
a soft smile on your mouth.
And the summer in your eyes
in your hair by the wind,
and you say: the sea is ripe.



Leave the water open ...

Leave the water open ...

When the water rises
and the creation day begins again,
we go hand in hand,
the tide comes with the west wind,
washes over our feet,
there is no life without the sea
and no land without sea.

Leave the water open ... <|endoftext|> 
This winter falls into silence
white and cold on me
wait in the ice and know
we, we are over

In my dreams our summer
you open your arms
it was more than just sunlight
unexpected and warmer

Where have you gone
with the birds?



Do you remember how wild the sea was
did I want too much?
it could no longer be held
like a handful of snow.

In the spring I slowly melt
cool tears for you
where you are
you stay close to me
there where I love you

You took so much from me
with the birds ..

You took so much of me with you. <|endoftext|> 
Child's play

There are a hundred thousand things
Which I had long forgotten
Looking at my own children
I only remember
Images from a distant past
Everything we did together
When I was young myself (When I was young myself)

And when the girls are screaming
The four of us in the bath
When my youngest is glands
With a head like I had then
When they build high huts
Have fancy dress parties
Then I recognize that

It is my own childhood
I remember
Discover the world for a second time
And I play with them
In all their dreams
the old story is retold
with part of every plan
with which they come
life is child's play

how they play that they are big
and seriousness has amazed me
when my 6 year old son got married
with the girl from here next to it
like those tricycles and bicycles
all those hands and those fries
are in such a hurry



It is my own childhood
I remember
Discover the world for a second time
play with them
In all their dreams
the old story is retold
with part of every plan
with which they come
life is child's play

as simple as that
is the child in the man
that you make you can do anything

play with them
In all their dreams
it's retold the old story
with part of every plan
with which they come
life is child's play

play with us
In our dreams
is the old story retold
with part of every plan
with which we come
life is child's play (2x)

child's play ... as simple as that ... <|endoftext|> 
The road to Soesterberg
Runs dead in the concrete
There an army drills fighter jets
Himself through the sun

A world behind barbed wire
Devastatingly guarded
There becomes the professional soldier
Made a real man

refr .:
    Johnny is a soldier
    It's war for him
    When the bomb falls
    Then he is ready

Dying is his profession
His weapon a target
For a hero, for a hero
It is never too late for a hero

The base has its own net
Commercials for 'the force'
As a citizen you never get such a star
On your chest



He sees me when he's rushing
But don't hear what I'm saying
That is not the way to peace
Peace is the way

I know what it's like to be young

But youth does not know a life of age

Every big boy was small once

But young boys do not know any real life




Youth is such a beautiful thing

Pristine and clean

Unfortunately it gets wasted

To those who are too young for it

Realize what it is

Rose scent and moonshine

Realize what it feels like

A body without pain




I know what it's like to be young

But youth does not know a life of age

Every big boy was small once

But young boys do not know any real life






They are working on their dreams

As if it's not called dreams

That little will come true

That is something youth does not know

They sing about love

But have no idea

There is more to love

Then that puppy love bullshit




Youth believes in peace

The good in people

Pass your chest down

Does he come true, that peace wish

And soon I will stretch my legs

In endless peace

Dan has my youngest grandson

Kissed for the first time




I know what it's like to be young

But I didn't know anything about old age at the time

Every big boy was small once

But young boys do not know any real life <|endoftext|> 
Child of the account
You are a child, of the wind and the water
Or a child born to the sun
But one hand carried you
Towards a construction of concrete
You are a child, without a mother or father
Or a child born in grief
And no one ever comes to ask
Whether you are happy or not

No, as a child of the bill
Don't you see the world that easily
As a drawing to be colored
Especially for you
You are a child, unloved and misunderstood
Or a child born in violence
doesn't just hide from rain
If bad weather is forecast for you again
You're a kid, on the run, settled here
Or even here, born in this country
As you are being looked at now
Sometimes freedom scares you

No, as a child of the bill
Don't you see the world that easily
As a drawing to be colored
Especially for you
But take a look around you
You are never alone
If you can share your dreams
If you can play together you are never alone
If you do it every day
Learn to live together
hey look around you



You are a child, without a mother or father
Or a child born in grief
And nobody ever comes to ask
Whether you are happy or not

No, as a child of the bill
Don't you see the world that easily
As a drawing to be colored
Especially for you <|endoftext|> 
Jim,
time has passed quickly
I can still see you there, beer in your hand
hey Jim we together in the pub
I remember you asked
hey what's going on
and I said I was fed up
I felt bad Jim
sometimes there are days when everything is a bit disappointing
oh so stupid of me Jim
that I didn't notice you
that you were much further than I could ever understand Jim

oooooh Jim why didn't you call later
and you want to die a hero
so sneaky without saying goodbye
why have you never told me
that you were tired of the fight
of the struggle for existence

I miss you Jim

oooh Jim we often laugh a bit
and it became deep in the night
then I slept with you Jim, yeah
I can still see us get up
around noon
then we baked eggs
and drank coffee from a soup bowl



and we talk further jim
about women and freedom
often we let go of the dog
along the sea where you once wanted to go as a boy

wooooh oh Jim
why didn't you call later
and you want to die a hero
so sneaky without saying goodbye
why have you never told me
that you were tired of the fight
of the struggle for existence

I miss you Jim

Jan Klaasen was a trumpet player in the Prince's army
He marched from Den Helder to Den Briel
He had no money and he was not a hero and he did not like the violence of war
But he was a trumpet player in heart and soul

The army pitched its tents in the field for Alkmaar
And as long as no enemy showed up, everyone was a hero
The pub was occupied by the headquarters as a strategic point
The officers roared, "John, come play your trumpet!"
They woke up in the gutter in the morning chilly and cold
But Jan Klaasen slept in the arms of the bailiff's daughter

(Chorus)

The Prince spoke to the major of the company upon inspection
"I saw all the pieces of my artillery here.
Yes, even that little one in your collar and that blonde in your bed.
But where is that piece of accident of a Jan with his trumpet
And no one saw Jan Klaasen sitting at the city gate
And played a hundred songs for the children of the city



(Chorus)

Jan Klaasen said: "Goodbye my love, I'll see you next year.
When spring returns we will be together again. "
Winter passed, summer came, the war was over
But the army never returned from the Mokerhei
No one has ever recovered anything from Jan Klaasen
But all children know him; he's not dead, he's alive!

(Chorus)

He had no money and he was not a hero and he did not like the violence of war
But he was a trumpet player in heart and soul <|endoftext|> 
I feel good
and watch TV to avoid going to bed.
And when it gets late
there are neighbors next to me
I hear their voice through the wall.
I am never alone.

The phone always has time
and shows me it.
There is always radio
and for a quarter I even talk to god.
Goodbye sir you are there.
Hear me, don't put it down.

And in winter extra blankets for the cold
some heating without you.
Oh, I'm stronger than you think
but still just as weak as far as you are concerned.



I saw your friend
he seems nice, well I know a lot
I thought at first, it will work out.
But he stays with you
It seems an established fact.
Do you well, I will lose you.

You have a beautiful house
It's like a picture.
No, I still live at home
I think it's best alone.
You should know that I do
don't like parties very much, nights long.
Nice man, you have a nice man.

And in winter extra blankets for the cold
some heating without you.
Oh yes, I know you will stay with him.
I'll have to get used to
to live without you <|endoftext|> 
The Orient with all its splendor
Has more faces than the moon
Believe for a thousand and one nights
That her fairytales don't exist

Because I hear Jerusalem
Crows like a hoarse rooster
Blood and tears in her voice
Torn apart by Torah and Quran

In all temples and mosques
Is still lived by faith
But beyond that Mary Magdalene
Where are the people who forget you

Inch Allah, Inch Allah, Inch Allah, Inch Allah.

Between rubble and barbed wire
A butterfly sits on a flower
And in a destroyed street
A children's shoe lies in the sand




God of Heaven or Hell
You who cannot prevent evil
Here is the sands of Jerusalem
Soaked in the blood of all her children

Inch Allah, Inch Allah, Inch Allah, Inch Allah.

About a border in the desert
The water flows from the well
I want to be like that water
A stream from Sadam and Sharon

Requiem for millions of dead
The Palestinians and the Jews
Was that a sacrifice to the gods
And now comes peace in their name?

Inch Allah, Inch Allah, Inch Allah, Inch Allah. <|endoftext|> 
The sweet warmth of your skin
is the first thing I smell in the morning.
You smell like hayfield where the sun
stood above for a summer day.
I raise my eyes and look
how to reach for the curtains.
Your hair weaves in the morning light
a golden haze around your face.

Not well woke up just out of bed
take care of your toilet while shivering.
And with a careless gesture
you take our clothes apart.
Oh, how I envy the robe
in which you will soon leave the house,
while I have to passively allow
that night and day do not go together.

I release you
but stay with me.
I would love to have you my sweetheart
always around me.
I will release you but stay with me.
Is our bond of love
can withstand this.



Very often you make a straightforward statement
a man must be free not bound.
I then turn to silence
because it leads nowhere anyway
if I say to you truthfully
that you impose on me so will you.
My heart beats when I wait
whether you return for the night.

I release you
but stay with me.
Perfect happiness exists
but until dawn.
I release you
but stay with me.
Why are you running
as soon as the alarm rings in the morning.

If you have no other choice
then go your own way.
I release you
but stay with me.
I will live by the day
If I can share your nights <|endoftext|> 
Nobody is perfect
don't promise anything
every dream you lose
changes something

As in our love
a void arises
you long for temptation
you seek that sweet treachery

Stupid stupid heart
how blind are you
lust is illusion, sweetheart
and passes

But what is love then
just a simple word
something of a miracle
of an everyday kind

And love is not perfect
never really perfect
love is not perfect
but incredibly beautiful



If it's later than late
hold your hair
thinks it's a compromise
between head and heart

You ask for trust
but does not look at her
you think men and women
never really understand each other

Stupid stupid heart
how blind are you
lust is illusion, sweetheart
and passes

But what is love then
just a simple word
something of a miracle
of an everyday kind

And love is not perfect
never really perfect
love is not perfect
but incredibly beautiful <|endoftext|> 
I'll tell you something
before we go to sleep.
I was working all day today.
I didn't have time for you today
and I've been curt.
But there were so many questions
and looking for an answer
I created problems again.
I've seen so much
that I am now in the dark
can't close my eyes.
But I would tell you something
before we go to sleep.

I'll tell you something
before we go to sleep.
Today I came to nothing
I have done nothing.
Oh I have planned so much
but I don't remember why.
Because if you start to think
and worry about others
others will pass you by.
And I've seen too much
I had my eyes open
and I can't close them anymore.
But I would tell you something
before we go to sleep.



I'll tell you something
before we go to sleep.
I know I've been way too concerned.
Maybe I wanted to forget
that I'm so lonely.

I wanted to tell you that
before we go to sleep:
that I need you. <|endoftext|> 
Nobody ever thought it

Hilda, Hilda
Who was so shy
Always at the office on time
Always on the right track
Hilda, Hilda, Hilda

For the first time in years
She came with beautifully curly hair
And then the story went around in the office
That she found her lover
Just on the street
And then after weeks
He looked forward to her body
And scared off by her plans, she only understood everything
But then it was too late

Nobody ever thought it
Nobody ever expected it
Hilda, Hilda
Who was so shy
Always at the office on time
Always on the right track

It took days
Before colleagues started asking
But Hilda had called in nicely
Her boss had told her
That she was acting strangely
After weeks when neighbors finally looked at her
The leftover tea was still on the table
She swallowed them there
There were enough

As my son stands next to me
And talk about new scooters.
Oow I was in a hurry like him
He looks like me..

Girls on the phone,
He is very ordinary tense.
Once I was just as young as him ...

He looks like me..
Something in his eyes I see again
In pictures from then ..
All of my youth comes over again.
Look my son, he looks like me.
Look my son, look he looks like me.

His clothes are still too small
Hey lanky say how tall will you be ..
He laughs a bit shy about it.

He looks like me..
Something in his eyes I see again
In pictures from then ..
All of my youth comes over again.
Look my son, he looks like me.
Look my son, look he looks like me.



Everything he does and says
Makes me proud I think rightly so
as my father thought of me,
look my son he looks like me.

He looks like me,
something in his eyes, I see again,
on photos from then,
all my youth comes over again,
Look my son, look he looks like me

The smile of a child,
but the voice of a man
Every day he finds more what he wants what he can do.
hangs out with friends at a fixed angle,
says don't worry, don't want me looking. Hey
His head full of pimples, hair in gel,
Winds through traffic like a virgin in hell.
He's watching violence on TV like nothing more than a game ...
He surfs the net around wayout for me,
He loves his dog like pepperie so happy,
Room a mess so keep it closed,
Drawers full of sheets of sex ...
How ... and Where ..

Opinion of what is cruel and what is not,
Sometimes a mumbled moment of grief.
A questioning look ... <|endoftext|>

And with that you say more than enough
Or did those words of mine sometimes fly
But love only comes too soon
Or maybe you are a bit shy
But being in love is very normal
You don't come across those butterflies every day
Do you know what I've been dreaming about for days now

Hey nice thing I hear you say
Then you don't have to explain anything anymore
I would love to hear from you
Keep that in mind

can't you see all my tears?

do not go away
we had so many wonderful hours
do not go away
they should last forever
do not go away
I really couldn't miss you
all my heart betrays great sorrow.

do not go away
I am trapped by the loneliness
do not go away
don't leave me in uncertainty
do not go away
I just can't forget you

do not go away
I don't know what to do with my feelings
do not go away
I have not lost hope yet
do not go away
or don't you want to hear this from me.



do not go away
I've always let you know ..
what my heart has felt for you for years
do not go away
you leave me here with a thousand questions
do not go away
your words are now all those days

do not go away
because I'm drowning in all my tears
do not go away
we were 1 all those years
do not go away
we walked hand in hand through life
do not go away
what I had I have given
do not go away

Chorus
Don't blame the night
It was love ...
Who hugged us, until morning
Have a little more patience
Then I'll be back with you
And our love flame still gets plenty of time

I've been a long time, so much more than a friend
But still I'm not with you ...
Give me a little more time.
You have earned my love forever
I know you love me a lot ...
It's that uncertainty.

Every time that goodbye to you
It also hurts me a lot
But believe me when I tell you
"That I want to be with you so badly."



Chorus

You keep asking me
not to leave
It is also difficult for me
Then I say to you, 'hold on for a while'
Then we are together for good

Chorus <|endoftext|> 
Today will be my day, I am sure
Today that will be the most beautiful day for me
Today that will be a day that absolutely everything is possible
Yes today only a smile counts for me
I forget my worries, don't think about tomorrow yet
Yes, today it is my turn
So no phone calls, that's too ordinary
No today I don't feel like all that nagging

    Hasta la vista, that's life, tonight the whole world is turned upside down
    Hasta la vista, nothing can stop me tonight I look for a cozy place
    Where people dance, but where people also laugh
    Where you can be yourself for a while
    With which every song is happily sung
    Because that's how it should always make sense
    Hasta la vista, that's life, tonight the whole world is turned upside down
    Hasta la vista, nothing can stop me tonight I look for a cozy place



I forget my worries, don't think about tomorrow yet
Yes, today it is my turn
So no phone calls, that's too ordinary
No today I don't feel like all that nagging

There's a train going to no man's land.
he's on his way to the promised land,
and you can hear the angels singing along the way
it seems like a dream that heavenly song.

Paradise as the final station
the ticket is a one-way ticket,
you will ever find peace there
although no one gets proof of this

There is a train running to no man's land
where the hell fire burns for no one,
only one flame will warm everyone
it's the love you long for.

Saying goodbye hurts everyone
you want so badly to be with the other,
what remains are 1000 beautiful dreams
but your heart is on that last train.



See the tunnel illuminate you
far to the sky high,
there you will recognize faces again
it is what you hope for.

There is a train running to no man's land

SECRET LOVE

I feel so lonely here again
I keep checking the clock
Whether you will come to me
Still keep a guess
I almost can not wait
Until you join me
I have in all my life
Never known such love

Chorus:
When night falls again
The day dawns for the two of us
We'll be together again in secret
As a witness a full moon
Our love cannot be tamed
It's just a matter of time
Until that day we are still in prison
But we will certainly be liberated



Look deep into my eyes
I know you will go
Nobody is cheated
Nothing standing between us
But why is love allowed
Not to be as it is
Hearts have no limits
The world that is wrong

Chorus

Chorus <|endoftext|> 
A song for everyone, lonely together let us dream
The world around us, which everyone forgets far too often.
A song for everyone, because the time has now come.

Don't leave anyone alone in a world full of suffering.

A song for everyone who has to fight for their life.
That fight never goes alone, help those other people, big or small.

A song for everyone that we help to pass on
A little more luck, my dream will one day come true.



Now shake hands and make the world one, ‚© íƒÆ'í‚ © n.
Give them a real chance, no one can do it alone.

A song for everyone, because the time has now come.
Don't leave anyone alone in a world full of suffering.

A song for everyone who has to fight for their life.
That struggle never goes alone, help those people big or small.

A song for everyone that we help to pass on.
A little more luck, my dream will one day come true.

Now shake hands and make the world one, ‚© íƒÆ'í‚ © n.

sitting here with my thoughts
lonely and so alone,
I'm upset
all day,
where are you say where did you go
just for a while,
It gave me such a strange feeling
now i'm sorry
I lost you,
will wait because I have the time

refr:
if only I had never looked at you
then I would not have succumbed to you
then I would not have been dreaming at night,
and hadn't hurt my heart,
if only I had never looked at you
then I wouldn't have known about you
now I'm waiting here for you to come
if only I had gone with you




all these hours go slowly
I'm totally upset
I'm broken
I'm looking bad
yet one day I'll find you

refr:
if only I had never looked at you
then I would not have succumbed to you
then I would not have been dreaming at night,
and hadn't hurt my heart,
if only I had never looked at you
then I wouldn't have known about you
now I'm waiting here for you to come
if only I had gone with you

    Any rose
    Is for you
    It tells: 'I love you
    All my life, I will give
    Any rose
    Is for you

A thousand words
Can say
You are everything, everything in my life
All your words
I close in my heart
That what I want to hear
Did you bring me

refr.



Where I'm going
You are with me
What am I supposed to do without you
All my life
Knows no sorrow now
Even if it is against
Tears don't help

I want to cross great seas with you
Together with the two of us
Withstanding every severe storm
Thinking of the words
Which you have told me so many times now
Have said

refr. (2x)

Is for you
Is for you <|endoftext|> 
So many beautiful words
You get used to it
Without final chords
So you don't know the end
Only the language of our eyes
Tell you what love is
But one thing you must know
That there is someone for you too

Once the sun shines again
And do you have someone around you
Everything is over
Are you no longer alone
Once in your life
you will be happy too
All those thousand tears
will then be gone
Once the sun will shine again
Come for you that beautiful day too
That life smiles at you forever



Living without love
Is like crying without a tear
That little bit of attention
The meaning in our beautiful existence
But you can also burn yourself here
The fire seems to have gone out for a moment
So much seems to have changed
Until someone believes in you

Once the sun shines again
And do you have someone around you
Everything is over
Are you no longer alone
Once in your life
you will be happy too
All those thousand tears
will then be gone
Once the sun will shine again
Come for you that beautiful day too
That life smiles at you forever

Once the sun shines again
And do you have someone around you
Everything is over
Are you no longer alone
Once in your life
you will be happy too
All those thousand tears
will then be gone
Once the sun will shine again
Come for you that beautiful day too
That life smiles at you forever <|endoftext|>

Then there will be a day for you
That happiness smiles at you again
Then the sun will shine for you too
Hope is more than just a dream
Life begins today, forget that lonely time
Because also grief that fades, no, don't look back
Everything behind you is over and really over
Please, live and feel free, and never think "why" again

Then there will be a day for you
That happiness smiles at you forever
(Someday there will come a day for you)
Live your life and still feel free
(That happiness smiles at you again)
Smiling at you again forever
(Once then the sun will shine for you too)
Don't look back because that is already over
(Hope is more than just a dream)

Now that I am a little older, say a warm voice deep inside me
The time has come to leave
Although I always feel at home here, I still look for my own home
I have to take care of tomorrow anyway

There will come a time when I have to go my own way
Then I will have to learn to live my own life
One day the day will come and my childhood will be over for good
I'll keep thinking about the words Dad said
Now you learn to fight, but we still support you



It seems a strange feeling to me, just going home to that empty chair
A chilly night, no one to wait
Yet you get used to this again, you have to get through life
But it will take a while, then I will be in life

There will come a time when I have to go my own way
Then I will have to learn to live my own life
One day the day will come, and my childhood will be over for good
I'll keep thinking about the words Dad said
Now you learn to fight, but we still support you

There will come a time when I have to go my own way
Then I will have to learn to live my own life
One day the day will come, and my childhood will be over for good
I'll keep thinking about the words Dad said
Now you learn to fight, but we still support you <|endoftext|> 
I've done everything but I can't find you
Past your friends, but I've lost your trail
You went here because you didn't want to tie yourself up
I did everything, but I still lost you
It could have been so beautiful, the two of us together
It could have been so beautiful, that little bit of luck
To be very close to you, for many years
It could have been so beautiful, but that's broken now

refr .:
    A thousand tears for you, those lonely hours
    Come where are you now, you should be here
    A thousand dreams of you, how long will this last
    But I am sorry and very sorry



I will never forget all those words of yours
I take all those dreams of you with me
What do I do without you, let me know
If you still love me, please don't say no

refr. <|endoftext|> 
I would love to say something to you
Even though words don't say much
It is not easy to explain
Although I know you want to hear this
What would I do without you
You who gave to me all your life
I don't have to make up words for you
Because you brought love into my life

refr .:
    This will be a day in a thousand dreams for us
    You and I got together
    Together we are on the road to happiness
    This will be a day in a thousand dreams for us
    I still ended up well
    But I know there is no turning back



I feel the heat flowing through my body
You set my whole heart on fire
I dream of those moments to come
Those hours together made me a man
You give me more love than the other
Uncertainty now fades from my heart
I hope this never changes
Because every day is always a fresh start

refr. <|endoftext|> 
An empty room
Without atmosphere, an empty feeling.
I count the days without love, without purpose.
Then I saw you, my world then stood still.
You have everything I want.
Heaven smiles when you're with me.

When I see you, I'm a little bit in love.
No, this should never pass.
Let the night be our friend.
Press close to me.
When I see you, I'm a little bit in love.
Night dream in the two of us.
About everything to come.
Baby I can't live without you.



I can laugh again.
So glad I found you.
I see colors again.
Birds are flying around.
This is happiness, if only small.
I want to be with you forever.
As long as I can wake up with your smile.

When I see you, I'm a little bit in love.
No, this should never pass.
Let the night be our friend.
Press close to me.
When I see you, I'm a little bit in love.
Night dream in the two of us.
About everything to come.
Baby I can't live without you.

When I see you, I'm a little bit in love.
No, this should never pass.
Let the night be our friend.
Press close to me.
When I see you, I'm a little bit in love.
Night dream in the two of us.
About everything to come.
Baby I can't live without you. <|endoftext|> 
(A little love, some sunshine, should always be there anyway.)

You look for a little happiness in life
Because sometimes you just lost that
Lost in your dreams
You want it back again
You live in that uncertainty.

And then you just talk to the stars
She asks about an angel
That helps you find happiness again
So that you leave the sadness behind.



*Chorus:

A little love for every day
Turns tears back into laughter.
Embrace your dreams
It gives you a lot of power.
A little love, some sunshine
There should always be.
And live your life
When luck awaits you.
3x

And live your life
When luck awaits you. <|endoftext|> 
Who dares to dance
On the edge of the ravine?
What is happening
In the dark of the brain
Disaster takes you along
Across all borders
A fatal alliance
But in chaos everyone is alone

Then all hell breaks loose!
All hell loose
Then all hell breaks loose!
All hell breaks loose

Friendship by fate
A pact with evil
In case of madness
Everyone will be late
Hear the scream
In the darkness
Who finds compassion
In the power of damnation?

Then all hell breaks loose!
All hell loose
Then all hell breaks loose!
All hell breaks loose

Then all hell breaks loose!
Wins pain from the mind
Chaos ensues
Then all hell breaks loose!
Chaos ensues <|endoftext|> 
I've always known that without food
No one can ever be really good
And I have always suspected who does his stuff
A war but then in miniature

But when it comes down to it
When there is fighting
On the cutting edge of the knife
then I think:
For a long time I lay beneath but without the despair
Of waiting in endless nights
I have faith in my head and my hands
I'll be upstairs soon
I'll be upstairs soon

I've always thought the forces
That drive me should be mine
And I've always said that when you fight
You no longer fear tired of blood and pain



When it comes down to it
When there is fighting
On the cutting edge of the knife
then I think:

For a long time I lay beneath but without the despair
Of waiting in endless nights
I have faith in my head and my hands
I'll be upstairs soon
I'll be upstairs soon

Know that any geuzen song can become a swan song
Like wild hurdles kick you like a dog
But the country never forces the bird
The sea never forces the lion
And the heart of every Zeeuw is not beating in a beat
But in the ground
I'll be upstairs soon <|endoftext|> 
Our happiness is over, you go on without me
All my love was for you, just for you
With you I could be happy, yes you were my sunshine
A thousand tears say I love you
In your eyes there is grief, but you don't want to stay here
I faintly estimate you, then maybe you are sorry
You gave me so much strength, you brought me happiness
A thousand tears say I love you



refr .:
    I'm waiting for you, I'll dream you'll come back here with me
    Laugh together cry together, all my life that's you
    One day you will regret, you will feel that loneliness
    A thousand tears say I love you
    A thousand tears say I love you

These are days without names
This is time but without rush
Open doors open windows
We are free but also amazed

In a brightly colored garden under the tree
Miracles always happen in a beautiful dream
But I am not dreaming now

These are days without names
Like two paper boats
In the water with no direction
Watch the light change here



But slowly under the branches of the tree
Very carefully the sun sets again as in a dream
But I'm not dreaming now

And you don't dream either

These days without names
Are in my memory
Regardless of places and seasons
As a very special thing <|endoftext|> 
A smile of yours shines more than the most beautiful starlight
A word from you says more than just a long poem
My love flame always burns just for you
Though love often flies through time, it still brings me to you forever

Deep in my heart I know there will never be another
Deep in my heart, even if that moment is so small
Nobody has ever given me such a warm feeling
I want to live for you, always be close to you
I want to live for you, always be close to you



A look from you sets me on fire
A day with you is like a journey through fairytale land
I kept your love letter all these years
It's just a piece of paper, but still remains worth so much to me

Deep in my heart I know there will never be another
Deep in my heart, even if that moment is so small
Nobody has ever given me such a warm feeling
I want to live for you, always be close to you
I want to live for you, always be close to you

Deep in my heart I know there will never be another
Deep in my heart, even if that moment is so small
Nobody has ever given me such a warm feeling
I want to live for you, always be close to you
I want to live for you, always be close to you <|endoftext|> 
Nice idea
You and me together
Together
And far from home
You came
And when we got here
I was at home

It's here
All of them
It's never what you expect
It is now
All the way
Let me dream night and day

No idea
When it ends
One day
Probably sometime
Nobody knows
Whether anything remains
Or no more



It's here
All of them
It's never what you expect
It is now
All the way
Let me dream night and day

It's here
All of them
It's never what you expect
It is now
All the way
Let me dream night and day

It is beautiful
It is large
But much different than expected
Leave me here
Until my death
Let me dream night and day

Day and night
Day and night <|endoftext|> 
My ship is already arriving there
I am watching from the beach
Writing in the sand
Is done for me now
Because the letters of your name
Do not stand in the sand

But the laws of the land
Do not apply on the high seas
So I'll take your name
Give me a goodbye
And forgive me for speaking out loud
All passes tel

Let's dance, my love
Dancing at the sea
Let's dance, my love
Dancing at the sea
A farewell waltz on the waterline
Dancing at the sea
One for your tears
Two for mine
Three for the horizon
To which we disappear

You knew who I was
Waving my coat
My arms wide and empty
And a heart that shouted silent
That demanded more and more
To the warmth of your cheek



Let's dance, my love
Dancing at the sea
Let's dance, my love
Dancing at the sea
A farewell waltz on the waterline
Dancing at the sea
One for your tears
Two for mine
Three for the horizon
To which we disappear

Say it was nothing
And say I was dreaming
Say I was crazy
Dare to say I was dreaming
Say I was stupid
But I didn't dream

Let's dance, my love
Dancing at the sea
Let's dance, my love
Dancing at the sea
A farewell waltz on the waterline
Dancing at the sea
One for your tears
Two for mine
Three for the horizon
To which we disappear <|endoftext|> 
Colors are colors
I sometimes thought
Not much is happening in this country
Through the glass in my hand
In the south of France
I suddenly see that the light changes softly
And it does something to me

Because the position of the sun
Turns bougainvillea into fireworks



Colors are colors
I sometimes think
Sooner or later they earn each other
And while I talk
On a sunny mountain
I suddenly know
That the light changes me
And it does something to me
And what matters

Because my heart knows why
I notice all of this
And the position of the sun
Turns bougainvillea into fireworks

Colors are colors
I sometimes think
They deserve each other
Sooner or later <|endoftext|> 
You wore blue again that night
In a shade of black light
Not a hole was closed
With the letter you sent to me
Time is everything
What used to be beautiful becomes ugly
And what you found so difficult then
You don't think about that anymore
Will you let me go?
What was unfinished will remain
You don't undo anything

Blue noise in my soul and in my ears
I don't want to hear it anymore, but it never ends
Blue noise, what you had is never lost
It just keeps getting harder and it never stops

You keep wearing blue that night
On the screen in my head
In the letter you sent to me
Didn't promise you anything
But nothing completed either
Unpleasantly numb
I keep staring at the ground

Blue noise in my soul and in my ears
I don't want to hear it anymore, but it never ends
Blue noise, what you had is never lost
It just keeps getting harder and it never stops



Will you let me go?
What was unfinished will remain
You don't undo anything

It just keeps getting harder and it never stops <|endoftext|> 
With the blessing of hope
I have come this far
And with the rain at my back
I know where I am
I know I can dream
 I will never go back
No, I will never go back

I'm almost where I need to be
Almost where I need to be
Almost in my place
That space is mine
And if I couldn't make it
Then I was close after all
I'm almost where I need to be

Closer to the ground
I signed up
And lighter in my head
I know who I am
I know that I will live
I will never go back
No, I will never go back



I'm almost where I need to be
Almost where I need to be
Almost in my place
That space is mine
And if I couldn't make it
Then I was close after all
I'm almost where I need to be

Almost where I need to be
Almost where I need to be
I'm almost where I need to be
Almost where I need to be

The 30th floor was not high enough for me
I looked out over the city, over the water
I was looking for something of yours, but only found something of myself
It didn't mean anything to me, that was for later
I was in Parc Guell
Between Gaudi's mosaics
So broken and so black and blue
Like everything in my head and in my heart
Up and down the Ramblas, I did hear music
But I knew it had changed forever
And there was nothing in Barcelona, ​​nothing in Barcelona
There was nothing in Barcelona, ​​nothing in Barcelona
More than once I thought I saw you in this town
That you waited for me for a moment somewhere
At a table in the middle, but when I looked closely there was nothing
A vision breaks in two at a thought
I ate on the street
And drank through deep dips
Let me drive around town
Along the whores, the pubs and the harbors
From north to south, and nowhere to get anything
And I knew I had changed forever
And there was nothing in Barcelona, ​​nothing in Barcelona
There was nothing in Barcelona, ​​nothing in Barcelona
I will come back someday
I go after Picasso
The hard strokes
From a sizzling brush
A reminder in advance
The memory of you
How you weren't there
And how you would never get there
Painted in your favorite yellow
Then there is something in Barcelona, ​​something in Barcelona
There was nothing in Barcelona, ​​nothing in Barcelona

As you sit on the porch
The way you look wild the garden I
Inaccessible to the eyes of the world
Just for me

As you seem old in your wisdom
As you love the ivy
Uninhibited when you look up to a butterfly
Just for me

Stay
Stay as now
Stay
Stay as now

As you lie stretched out in the sun
The way you get tanner than me
Clumsy when you wake up drunk asleep
Just for me



Stay
Stay as now
Stay
Stay as now
Stay as now
It's too good today
It's too good today
It's my whole being wondering why
it can't always be that way.
It's your beauty
It's your goodness
The best that can happen
Then recognize it

And stay
Stay as now
Stay
Stay as now

As you think about sunlight
Like you always stay with me
Untouchable, you lie next to me in the dark
Just for me

Stay
Stay as now

Stay as now
Stay as now
Stay as now

Stay as now
Stay as now <|endoftext|> 
Waiting for the sun to rise
Is a way to always see the light again
And forget the night again
Staring at the horizon
Something like not looking anymore
Of reaching further and further
What you couldn't do before

It will be better
It gets better together
And we know that tomorrow is close
And so over again
We are bigger
Together we are bigger
So we toast to days
Full of sunlight that can support any weight

Sailing on a distant star
Is a way to always see a way
And how to get home
Body to the balance
Like dancing on a tightrope
Still gives a panoramic view
It's a bit like dreams



It will be better
It gets better together
And we know that tomorrow is close
And so over again
We are bigger
Together we are bigger
So we toast to days
Full of sunlight that can support any weight

Don't let my hand
Don't let go of my hand
You don't have to do this alone
Don't let my hand
Don't let go of my hand
You don't have to do this alone

It will be better
It gets better together
And we know that tomorrow is close
And so over again
We are bigger
Together we are bigger
So we toast to days
Full of sunlight that can support any weight <|endoftext|> 
Commit me to the ghosts
From the past, now and later
They have always been there
They have always been there
Commit me to the land
Commit me to the water
Without a mother, without a father
It has always been there

Change me, move me
Take my head in your hands
Bring it inside out
The outer within
And let it dry in the wind

Yele! Yele! Yele! Yele!

Nipeleke kwenyo roho
We sasa wa bare, na milele
They have always been there
They have always been there
Nipeleke kwenye arthi
Nipeleke kwenye maji
Bila mama, bila baba
Siwame kuwa wapo



Change me, move me
Take my head in your hands
Bring it inside out
The outer within
And let it dry in the wind

Nipeleke kwenye roho
Wa sasa na wa kale, na milele

Change me, move me
Take my head in your hands
Bring it inside out
The outer within
And let it dry in the wind

Change me, move me
Take my head in your hands
Bring it inside out
The outer within
And let it dry in the wind

Merge into the smoke
It's also allowed tonight
Be something different

Blending in with the rest
It's okay tonight
Be something different

Immerse yourself in the game
It's allowed tonight
Be something different

Engage in combat
It really has to be tonight
Be something different

And if I wait until it gets better
Nothing happens and I come
always too late
And if I wait for you to say anything
Then it remains silent ...



We will die anyway
It is still possible tonight
Be something different

We ever die
But tonight it can be beautiful
Be something different

And if I wait until it gets better
Nothing happens and I come
always too late
And if I wait for you to say anything
Then it stays quiet and comes
nothing right
What I want
Then there is never even air that vibrates
Then it stays calm and quiet forever

Tonight

One movement, one moment
we are here together, you and me
A light flashes on and off in my head
Like in a silent movie
so only image and no sound

My brain not my shepherd
Is this my hand, a little further each time?

That hand moves, but is neither still
And I don't know what I want with it
Do I want to caress you, or rather a glass?
To hold on to who I was

My brain not my merder
Is this your hand, a little further each time?

I feel it now
I touch the world
I feel it now
It never was
Always tonight
Under the sky
Always tonight
Under the sky



My eyes open, my eyes closed
It's dark like that, it's light like that
The world revolves, revolves around a pivot
Everything moves, everything stands still

My brain not my shepherd
Is this my hand, a little further each time?

I feel it now
I touch the world
I feel it now
It never was
Always tonight
Under the sky
Always tonight
Under the sky

My brain not my shepherd
Is this my hand, a little further each time?

I feel it now
I touch the world
I feel it now
It never was
Always tonight
Under the sky
Always tonight
Under the sky <|endoftext|> 
How much do all those hundreds of promises weigh
Which I've already done
I can't remember
To whom and where
And which ones I broke
And which ones I could keep

It's never enough
It's too much to mention
What you want to do well
And everything comes too soon
It's never enough
But it has to be done that way
Because it sometimes opens the doors to

The man that I am
The man I was
The man I will be
When this is all over

How many roads can I walk
Before I fall for you
How far can I go?
Is it worth it?
When I take an oath
And so commit myself again
By keeping me free

I am part of the whole

who will you be
if I disappear

I can't move
My house is falling apart
So collectively furious
And never finished with anything

I can't do with it
All that old shit
Throw it overboard
Put it on the sidewalk
Don't keep anything from then
Nothing more to do

Everything has to go, everything has to go
Everything has to go, everything has to go

I can't take it anymore
Because my head is bursting
The mess in my attic
Is too heavy on my heart



I can't do anything with it
All that old shit
Throw it overboard
Put it on the sidewalk
Don't keep anything from then
Nothing more to do

Everything has to go, everything has to go
Everything has to go, everything has to go
Everything has to go, everything has to go
Everything has to go, everything has to go

Boxes full of the past
Boxes full of pain
Boxes of remorse
But it doesn't have to be

Everything has to go, everything has to go
Everything has to go, everything has to go
Everything has to go, everything has to go
Everything has to go, everything has to go
Everything has to go ! <|endoftext|> 
It went differently than we thought
Who also expects everything to remain as it is
But it never feels the same it is a matter of the sunlight
And a matter of the weight of the things we do
And also the things we see
In all countries where we live
And the daughters and the sons next to the bed every morning

I'm here waiting for you
Even when you're lying next to me
your face turns out to be the most beautiful again
This is a proposal without rings
And I'm not asking for your hand but your fingers pointing to myself

It went faster than we thought
Who also expects that everything can ever be this big
That it goes higher than mountains and faster than hurricanes
That the ocean appears shallow at the hole that can enter

I'm here waiting for you
Even when you're lying next to me
your face turns out to be the most beautiful again
This is a proposal without rings
And I'm not asking for your hand but your fingers pointing to myself

We don't expect anything but still



Did you know where it would end up
That you can't take anything for granted
It's stranger than dreams
Even if it goes so naturally

I'm here waiting for you
Even when you're lying next to me
your face turns out to be the most beautiful again
This is a proposal without rings
And I'm not asking for your hand but your fingers pointing to myself

I'm here waiting for you

This is a proposal without rings
And I'm not asking for your hand but your fingers

This is a proposal without rings <|endoftext|> 
It's not hard to see that the stock is slowly running out, but maybe that's okay
because then you have to on your own
and try to prove it
that what you do is good

To everyone
To everyone who waits
anyone waiting for a spring sun to everyone
who gently hopes for a miracle
to everyone who laughs everything away and always walks away
to anyone who thought he didn't dare to be brave

It's easy to know what to do if you fall over
but it is better if you feel that you can come to it safely
because someone will catch you
and that's how it is meant to be



For everyone
for everyone who waits
anyone waiting for a spring sun
anyone who gently hopes for a miracle
anyone who laughs everything away and always walks away
for anyone who thought he didn't dare to be brave

Everything is love
For those who want it
And for those who still dare to dream
About wonderful princes on white horses
Who cannot drive well
And keep their secrets for a long time
And everything is love too
For those who quietly desire

Everything is love
Everything is love
For someone like you
For him, for her, for me

Everything is love
For those who can
And for those who really dare to look
For those who dare to look for something
Even for those who only,
dare to hope for the smallest bit

And you know,
Everything is love too
For those who quietly desire
To that one present,
that no one expected yet
And of which no one had thought
ever to give it



Everything is love
Everything is love
For someone like you
For him, for her, for me
Everything is love
Everything is love
For those who think it's too late
Luck sometimes awaits somewhere around the corner

Is it disappointing that the wait sometimes takes so long?
Is it disappointing now that it seems that nobody is watching?
And for those who think it's too late
Luck sometimes awaits somewhere around the corner

Everything is love
Everything is love
For someone like you
For him, for her, for me
Everything is love
Everything is love
Everything is love <|endoftext|> 
every time
every time I think of her
how she smiles
how she talks
how she knows why
every time
every time I think of her
pretty much all day
I get to little else

every time
again and again
more and more

every time
every time I see her
in every woman
on every street
from early morning to late at night
every time
every time I see her
it appears in all my dreams
and when I'm up they continue



every time
again and again
more and more
every time I love her more

once and for all
she is in my cup
I will not lose her
she just doesn't stop

every time
every time I think of her
all day
just about
and at night no less rather more
every time
every time I think of her
she keeps getting better and better
she goes on and on it can't go on

every time
again and again
more and more
every time I love her more <|endoftext|> 
If I were you
and you were me
if possible
and we could watch
in each other's heads
with each other's mind
if you could see everything with different eyes
then you will see that you have always been sight blind

Chorus:
Stand in my shoes
Stand in my shoes
you had my shoes on what would you have done
Stand in my shoes

your whole world is just as rough
if you can imagine
what you want to see
you can see that around you
so be careful in your judgment of another
Who is without sin;
Cast the first stone.



What you sow
whatever you sow you will reap
Oo and you and I are basically all 1

Chorus:
Stand in my shoes
Stand in my shoes
you had my shoes on what would you have done
Stand in my shoes

all the bullshit in the world for the same thing
wrong people, wrong god, wrong skin

I have the jokes and you have the laugh
and we have each other



and we have the night

gone forever too late
we stand and watch
how one thing drags another
how it all passes
without anything happening

honey come here

I don't like it anymore
all because of you
you are in my heart
and you're in my cup
that has to get out
what are we waiting for

you know the roads and I know the tent
I know my weaknesses and you are my strength
and we have each other

you loved this view
you loved to go here
I'm sitting alone at the same table now
this is where it started
the memory shines
that it had to come to this bitter end

this bitter end
you should have been here long ago

i asked for two coffees
just like old times
mine is on now and yours is cold
I ask for two more coffees
suppose she appears
and a few extra lumps for this bitter end



this bitter end
here we sat talking
everything made sense here
now I'm talking to myself
against all knowledge
that you just like then
appears here shortly
oh what a sweet start
oh what a bitter ending

two coffees are waiting
in vain on a customer
i loved that view your lipstick on the rim
how would it be
when everything disappears
and this bitter end comes to an end

this bitter end
you should have been here long ago <|endoftext|> 
The singer of the last song:

The singer of the last song
Seeks words but cannot find them
Searches words to get real one more time
To say what must be said
Before it's over and quiet
And becomes bald and calm and shrill

The singer of the last song
Seeks words but cannot find them
He listens and thinks, walks around
Looks around, stares at the ground
He eats, he reads, he sees TV
He walks with some friends



Sometimes he hears something, he catches something
That buzzes in his head for days
But words for his last song
They are not nearly yet

The singer of the last song
Looks for words but cannot find them
The need is urgent, the time is short
For the last song that sings everything
That antidote mixes, gives clarity
And silences all the uproar

How do you sing what's crooked straight
How do you really sing what is false
How do you sing what's stupid right
How do you sing good fortune
How do you sing comfort in defeat
How do you sing answer in a plague
How do you sing sunlight in the gray
And how especially: I love you

The singer of the last song
Seeks words but cannot find them
And he concludes: This is no longer possible
He gives up, he lies down
His wife and children at his bedside
Finally hear very softly
His voice, his last breath
Smothered narrowly
Do not forget me <|endoftext|>

this city
always something
nothing to plan
yet flat again
want or not
you are coming
this city
knows no no

and you know it's ending
with a suitcase full of remorse

this town is a very beautiful woman

neon light
glance
flesh is weak
tack
no defense
no excuses
live once
live now



and how she turns her hips
and how tight her sweater

this town is too beautiful a woman
too beautiful a woman
you give everything you have
but she doesn't give a damn about you

this city
more than enough
nothing to plan
yet flat again
like or like
yes or yes
this city knows
no mercy

and you know how it ends
but how blue her eyes are

this town is too beautiful a woman
too beautiful a woman
you give everything you have
but she doesn't give a damn about you <|endoftext|> 
one of those days that don't require me to shimmy in the dark
no use no task no duty
a monster without value
no body no face
for no valid reason
I'm screwing things up here
I have nothing to offer them
no alibi no goal

I do not know what it is
sometimes i'm just scared
to come and get me
I've been here too long
and I have no appeal and no defense
and nothing to soften anything
I squeeze him for the charge
like a thief in the night

followed by frightened looks
with the cataracts of fear and duty
by too often cheated eyes
weighted and too light
that feeling of too much
unwanted and suspicious
I squeeze it before it gets light



but the nights are free
the night is mine
the night is mine
with under my skin
that precious booty
that feeling of being free and suspicious
like a thief in the night

now I walk through the puddles
and the mess in the gutter
with the rats on the ropes
between shore and boat
although I don't find what I'm looking for here
it is more than i expected
that's how I prefer to walk

because the nights are free
the night is mine
the night is mine
with under my skin
that precious booty
that feeling of being free and suspicious
like a thief in the night <|endoftext|> 
day or night makes no difference
day or night it is one
for twenty-four hours nothing
then emptiness around me

day or night makes no difference
I don't see any distinction
a dense mist of tears
and a sea of ​​solitude

and the sun rises for free
the sky is meaningless blue

the sun is just setting
the sun is just setting
the sun is just setting
without you



day or night makes no difference
the same darkness
what can go wrong goes wrong
what can go well goes wrong

day or night or night or day
it's the same grind
a wall to stare at
no windows and no door

and the sun rises for free
the sky is meaningless blue

the sun is just setting
the sun is just setting
the sun is just setting
without you

without you
without you
there's nothing wrong with it
without you <|endoftext|> 
you are raking in your garden, sir
you look up
it might rain
maybe it will stay dry
or would it still blow?
you put on a jacket
enjoy the silence

you look through the windows
you lower your shutters
is it time for the news yet?
look at the weather
you are well insured
but you don't know what's coming
this is just the silence
the calm before the storm



you throw some logs on your fire
you lock your door
you take a nice glass
but where is the pleasure?
you think of too many things
and you don't know why
is that because of the drink
or the calm before the storm?

and you get too distressed
you unbutton
you can feel the mood
why doesn't it break loose?
and your headphones are spinning tunes
don't bother about it
but nothing drives away the silence
the calm before the storm

but the storm drifts over
and you change your shirt
you can see blue sky again
you are quite a guy
you hear the news rattle again
you go around the block
you hear birds in the silence
the calm before the storm <|endoftext|> 
the fire must keep burning
and hope must not fail
and the mind must be able to blow
because the spark can spread

yes the horses now run on diesel
and the carts are now a trailer full
and the pull bag are electric guitars
the blue barge is now called rock & roll

but not much has changed
although the annual fair is now a festival
girls boys come from far and wide
for the music from anywhere, anytime

because the fire must keep burning
and hope must not fail
and the mind must be able to blow
because the spark can spread

like the rhythm deep deep from the jungle
at the tam-tam on Saturday evening
and the wizard strikes the deaf chord
and the women kick in the clay



because there is more than struggling in the fields
because there must be more than tigers in the forest
the men are going to drink laughing dicks
the women shake off their bodies

because the fire must keep burning
and hope must not fail
and the mind must be able to blow
because the spark can spread

from Nieuwegein to Oldebroek
from curves to beesd
we have been
from schorredijk via Oudezeer
through graft to mere spirit
we have been
siddeburen swalmen baflo
bisde slicker feather
and when they call tomorrow
we will be there again the day after tomorrow

because the fire must keep burning
and hope must not fail
and the mind must be able to blow
because the spark can spread

the fire must keep burning <|endoftext|>

half the world is watching the crew with excitement
in images of the rolling of the waves of the sea

we are all in the same ship
in the same boat in the same clip
we are all in the same boat
and we can't figure it out

we are all in the same ship

even when it is quiet on the street
and the cars stop at the side
the pubs are closed and there is no one to be seen
and nowhere sirens and fire

even when it is quiet on the street
no train in the distance whistling
there is no abuse, there is no fighting
it is quiet and yet you hear sound

is it a child
is it a woman
a man maybe
or a cat in a corner
or is it the wind
at the end of the century
it is the wind



even when the house is quiet
no radio on
the newspapers
no blood and deceit on TV
it is quiet and yet you hear sound

it is the jungle
or the desert
is it hunger is it pain
or is it the wind
at the end of the century
it is the wind

is this the wind? <|endoftext|> 
there the hero rushes
the cowboy in the white hat
a man a horse
at full speed towards injustice
robbed the bank - the village in turmoil
the sheriff's blondest daughter kidnapped

bad was bad
good was good
you just looked at the color of the hat

the villain he sucks
his whiskey after counting the putt
an unshaven grin
under a black hat
the blonde daughter is stuck with a rope
her chest rises and falls - where is he now



bad was bad
good was good
you just looked at the color of the hat

but now
the black villain is gray
the loot still missing
where are they now
those heroes of the silver screen
to dranl and daughters
or president or severe dementia or never exist

bad was bad
good was good
you just looked at the color of the hat <|endoftext|> 
If only you could with a song
Stop hunger
Make poverty disappear
Once and for all
If only you could through a song
Drop the weapons
Let the sun shine again
Then I sure did

If only you could with a song
Solving the world suffering
End war
To hatred and violence
That you with a song again
Deserts could forest
That the ocean became clean again
The ozone layer is restored

That would be nice
That would be nice
That turned out to be a beautiful song
With a beautiful bouquet
And a wonderful chorus
But I don't make them that beautiful



If only you could with a song
Performing wonders of God
Let the lame walk
Show the blind
If only you could with a song
Make peace forever
And demolish all those churches
Then I made ten

That would be nice
That would be nice
That turned out to be a beautiful song
With a beautiful bouquet
And a wonderful chorus
But I don't make them that beautiful <|endoftext|> 
I do nothing and I do nothing
I'm just hanging around
look through the windows
and I scratch my ass
I don't see and hear nothing
my head is full of sorrow
I just feel the bleeding
the bleeding of my heart

a bleeding heart
I have that now
a bleeding heart
just about you
is it really over now
you beautiful woman you dear woman
only you can help me
but you're not there
not to staunch me
bleeding heart

I do nothing and I leave nothing
I'm just staring ahead
I'll just have another beer
I play some on my flute
I get up and go to bed
because it should
I'm waiting for what's to come
when I've bled out



a bleeding heart
I have that now
a bleeding heart
just about you
is it really over now
you very beautiful woman
only you can help me
but you're not there
not to staunch me
bleeding heart

I do nothing and I do nothing
I'm just hanging around
I look through the windows
and I scratch my ass
I don't see and hear nothing
my head is full of sorrow
I just feel the bleeding
the bleeding of my heart

a bleeding heart
I have that now

How do you record a past
You look at the landscape
You are traveling through a city
And thinks about what happened

Capture his memories
They penetrate to the present
You listen to the story
From an accidental passerby

This day is the future
This day is the future



The wind blows around the house here
The trees move slowly
And lose another year

Time does not stand still here
The clouds rush by
The city smokes in the distance

This day is the future
This day is the future <|endoftext|>

Look at the towers
Look at the river
Across
Rises the city
Above the water
On a slippery slope
There it was
There is that city

Seeking
The hidden city
Seeking
the vanished city
But never lost sight of it

Look at the fields
Look at the hills
On the horizon
There is a light



Above the water
There it is
There is that city

Seeking
The hidden city
Seeking
The lost city
But never lost sight of it <|endoftext|> 
In the morning I walked along the sea
I thought about forgotten music and books

The further away from home
The further away from home
The more you remember

I also thought about your question
What it was all about

I think it is
About a desire
About a desire
About a desire



To something that cannot exist
About a desire
To something that cannot exist
That cannot exist

Maybe something lost
On the way
When we were busy
With finding a direction
With finding an existence

You know how that goes
So much has been lost in our world

But I have the idea
I have the idea
That you keep something secret
For everyone <|endoftext|> 
I walked in town today
People spoke to me
As well as an old friend
With a clear glance
With a clear glance

I walked down the street today
Where I have lived for a long time
For a moment it looked like then
With a surprising shine
With a surprising shine

In the tobacconist the man asked
How I was doing
I said we live in a different time
He said: nothing just passes
Nothing just passes

Just over
Nothing just passes
Just over
Nothing just passes



The past disappears in smoke
As in a misty dream
Did it ever exist
Was none of it true

There is no answer to the question
There is only wonder
As on this winter day
This winter day
This strange day

Just over
Nothing just passes
Just over
Nothing just passes <|endoftext|> 
The world is uglier then
I thought
Who do you ask for directions here
I read fear in all eyes
Lock the door and throw away the key
The world is sleeping
The world is awakening
The world turns around
In her mud bath

Her past is more painful
than I thought
Pages long
Battle after battle for power
Until she was owned



There is only one of her
And who appropriates her
Why was her prize
So often paid in blood

The world is sleeping
The world is awakening
The world turns around
In her mud bath

The world is uglier then
I thought
And I didn't have much hope
The world is smiling
Towards her doom
The world is sleeping
The world is awakening
The world turns around
In her mud bath <|endoftext|> 
The painter and his model
Her soft neck
Gets even softer
Because of the paint on the linen

A brush with eyelashes
Seen through the eyelashes
Everything becomes round and filled
With a hidden desire

The tricks of the master

Is this a representation of reality
Or does reality reflect this
Back in the eyes of the painter
Where there is peace and beauty



The tricks of the master

It will be quite a struggle
There on that white canvas
The painter has conquered
The doubt was lost for a while

The painter and his model <|endoftext|> 
Today
We walked in the autumn sun
You said
That you had escaped the dance

And we laughed
To the light
And we celebrated
Our old friendship

You are safe for now
They had said
And now we are here
This is the right way

And I keep you close to me
See you across the street
I keep you close to me
See you across the street



And across the street
The tears came
You said
That you had escaped the dance

Relief
That feeling
And your lover
Held you tight

You are safe for now
They had said

And I keep you close to me
See you across the street
I keep you close to me
See you across the street
I keep you close to me
See you across the street
I keep you close to me
See you across the street

This road is full of danger
Watch where you go
take your time
Take life
As it goes <|endoftext|> 
Then we drove west
The last rays of the sun
Shone on the bottom of the sky
Two friends on their way

It would be one of the last times
What is there to discuss
Too old to look back
Too young to look ahead

To look forward
Too young to look ahead
Too old to look back

It was quiet in the car
The words disappeared with the sun
The shared experiences
The cautious memories



Friendship is love
Love is friendship
You don't need words there
To make dirty

Too young to look ahead
Too old to look back
Too young to look ahead
The bottom of the sky

Rarely seen such a beautiful sunset
What is God
What an artist God is <|endoftext|> 
Look at the moon
Look at me
Look how small we are
Grains of sand in the wind

Shout at the moon
Shout at me
Cry out your heart
I hold you in the wind



The wind took him
He never comes again

The night is dark
We are dark
We are brother and sister
Strangers to each other
What am I to you
You have no use for me
But you look like me
And together we are in the wind
The wind took him
Forever

What can I do for you
Be a consolation
Like a brother should do for his sister
Like a brother should do for his sister <|endoftext|> 
The first day

It's gotten late tonight
The Belgian nightlife shows no mercy
I really enjoyed it
And now I have to suffer
I even dared to dance
Quite a lot for a wooden-legged singer
And creaky joints
Ah when will my body do
What my mind desires

A song is running through my mind
Inaccessible and elusive
Hence that pain
Take it easy today


The second day

The world moves on
The crashing plane
The former Yugoslavia
Starving Somalia
Bush versus Clinton
The Eastern European failure et cetera et cetera
You can't turn your butt either
You are not paying attention
And it will be a mess again
Today I am Atlas
And hurt my neck

The haunted song showed his face for a moment
Sweet and terrifying at the same time
I'm curious


The third day

Friends Day
In particular dear dear Ger
Invited to dinner
At the home of the friendly restaurateur
How many courses, how many bottles of wine
Talking about the past
The unprocessed past
The ever-present past
So far away and so close
A smile and a tear
Our friendship will never end
Are you careful when you drive home?
Goodbye dear boy


The fourth day



Life can be beautiful
From tralalala tralalala
A bright autumn morning
Search chestnuts
Loaded our bags
Ha that bitter white skin
Dirty nails stiff mouth
Walking in the woods with Tiny
Talk about relationships
Talk about talk
Talk about fear
Talk about happiness
That unattainable soft happiness

The haunted song suddenly took off
To a melody


The fifth day

Always the nerves when I get in the car
And like a drop falling from heaven
Drop down to the south
Is it because I drive alone
I'm afraid I can't find it
The meter always goes too far to the right
Look at those snails next to me
Here I come
Tonight I'll try every song
As a separate chapter
To be recited from the book of life
Behind the happiness behind the pain
Is a bright place
As bright as above the snow line
Where the sun shines
Cold and warm
Continued lived through thought
Heart broke, heart healed
Continued with a glued heart
But it is sometimes damn quiet
Votes change by the hour
Four seasons in one day
Maybe the haunted song will help
I like the melody
A healing pain a comforting purification
A kamikaze-like passion
Want to do everything want to tell everything
Making everything happen without inhibitions
Until bleeding


The sixth day

Until bleeding
And now it is over
Well I want to know
What is it about
What does it say
What shall I make it say
Always under control
Tame the horse
Jump on it and force it to its knees
Anxiety desolation fear
Relief promise sensuality
Laughed that we have

I've caught the haunted song
Here on paper
Here in my voice
In my words
I like it
It was so pushy


The seventh day

Sunday morning music
Beethoven dressing gown and piano music
The deaf composer
The color-blind painter
The stupid singer
Today to the hospital
People staring in the hall
To the gray corridors at the back
Far away in the disease maze of
Understanding looks of white coats
No flowers, no fruit
No words, no face
I open the door
And kiss him on the forehead
Hold my heart
Hold his hand
Read a poem
Immortal Conversations
Rest resignation pain
And then still that smile
Not in his eyes
But his mouth
Marius the Mona Lisa
Marius's smile

Later in the hall with an imaginary stengun
Anyone staring
Shot over <|endoftext|> 
It was an unknown road I've traveled
to the light in search of the dark.
Longing for longing, from that armor of regret,
jealousy and interests.
On the way, helmsmen on shore spewed their bile,
they never achieved anything, I remained stubborn.

And then when I saw you
you've been so much to me
a mother, a daughter, the most beautiful woman.
But as always with someone who never knows for sure
my doubt won over our luck but tonight I'm back here
and I ask you ...

Love me, love me, love this body.
Love me, free me from the darkness in my head,
my street ends here.



What haunted me here
was it the price of fame,
or the desire to trust someone for one night.
Or was it that hyena, that jackal, waiting for me to fall
and who I thought was a friend.

But aren't we stronger together than anything that threatens me
I'm ready for battle, with the truth as a weapon
and that is

Love me, love me, love this body.
Love me, free me from that sense of guilt
betray me with a kiss

Love me, love me
I know I can't ask more questions.
We reconcile tonight
love me
caress me,
all me,
love me <|endoftext|> 
The ferryman never chose
A river flows in his eyes
On the way to the end by chance
To disappear there
Without a trace

His sweetheart keeps his distance
To protect her soul
But at high tide
Her doubts disappear
And the ferryman does not trust it

refr .:
    Sailing from bank to bank
    Up and down in rain in storm
    And when the last stranger is far away
    The story of the ferryman is heard



On that day across the street
Is the sun breaking through or is there fog
The water whispers its name
The ferryman
It asks the wind

Who tells him about the future
And what the strangers do to each other
And about his love who will come one day
Will understand him
Without a word

refr. (2x)

The story of the sun and the moon
The story of love and hate
The story of life and death <|endoftext|> 
And I heard
Birds sing
Birds sing
An unknown song
A cheerful song

And in the distance
The towers flash
The towers flash
From San Gimignano

Through the trees
Behind the church
Between the dead



Look at the sky
Count the stars
Look at the sky
So far away
Unreachable
Far away

Through the trees
Behind the church
Between the dead

And in the distance
The towers flash
The towers flash
From San Gimignano
From San Gimignano <|endoftext|> 
And you talk
But you talk without feeling
And you look
But you look without seeing anything

And you answer without asking anything

And you smile
But your eyes don't count
And you just do
But you actually act so strange

And you're trying to seduce me

refr .:
    And oh I cry in the dark
    And oh I'm in the dark
    And oh I'll show you myself
    But you don't see it
    No you don't see it



And you think
But you think without your heart
And you walk
But you're not going anywhere

And you're trying to seduce me

refr.

And you talk
But you talk without feeling
And you look
But you look without seeing anything

And you're trying to seduce me

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Come on let's go
The bottle is empty
I'll take you home
It's safe

We have talked
After all this time
We have laughed
To mistakes
About thoughts
How it would have gone
It's too late now

refr .:
    But your face
    And your mouth
    It's so familiar
    It's unbearable
    That distance
    I would love to
    With you
    Oh dear

It makes no sense
To stand still
With what happened
Do not you think



What more can I do
What more can you do
Then move on

To live on
With this reminder
This madness
Don't stop
I let you go

refr.

Your arms
And your eyes
It's so familiar
It's unbearable
That distance
I would love to
With you
Oh dear <|endoftext|> 
It's in the newspaper
A boy has been murdered
Just for no reason
No reason
Violence is increasing
Why
Why are we close to each other
Why do we make
This world
To hell
Against all knowledge
I still believe

I believe in better times
Everything will be different someday
Even if you are young if you are old
Who does not believe in tomorrow
It has been dark for so long
We are ready hand in hand
The lie has been stolen
The day of our dreams <|endoftext|> 
And suddenly she had her mother's eyes.
Young woman had disappeared,
disappeared into life.

What shall we drink the start of a long evening there's a lot to tell, I've got something for you

I have something for you with me

And of course we are friends in this heart-hearted time, but we are not always so.
I've missed you, I change my mind now.

and .. yes the love, the love what shall we say about it. Luck smiles at you now who could have ever imagined that.
Who could have ever imagined that.



I hope to see you again soon, this evening has done me good. Lost together in time, glad glad I found you again.

Go now
But now go
Go now
Go now
Go now

Go now

Before I ask you anything else

And suddenly, she had her mother's eyes. <|endoftext|> 
I have a conversation every day
A conversation here in my head
About what I've done
About what has happened
About what I have done wrong

I talk to myself every day
Without words but as in a dream
Then I see dissatisfied friends before me
Friends with misunderstood girlfriends
And I'm on the side

How tight is the rope on which I dance
Between my head and my heart
How long will it be before I fall
Between my head and my heart



Every day I ask myself
When am I old and wise enough?
Without doubts or rash actions
An eccentric penniless and abandoned
From God and everyone

refr .:
    Because how strong is this cord on which I dance
    Between my head and my heart
    How long will it be before I fall
    Between my head and my heart

The life of a tightrope walker
In balance out of balance
In balance

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Snow is falling on the street
Behind the window on the street
Today today is the day
I get a prize
For my job
For my pain

And everyone everyone
everyone will be there
Hypocritical that they are
Wonder where I'm staying

refr .:
    The price
    The pain
    I'm at the window
    I step out of the window
    The price is on the street
    The price is on the street



Snow has been falling for years
in the park on the street
An old man an old man
An old coat
That's all I am
no more than a thief of language
And everyone everyone
everyone steals from me
Their poems are mine
They are waiting for me now
Always

refr.

And they are silent
And they are silent
And they silence me to death <|endoftext|> 
That overwhelming silence
during your absence
What I have dreamed of and
what I feared
That silence is so great

Bigger than the sea
Bigger than the pale moon
Bigger than the Piano van
Beethoven
Beauty has no time



And can not even silence
breaking through
No matter how loud the sound
Like the motors of
the plane
That took you away from me

In heaven you dissolved
Like a star that falls
But I have no wish
done i read
the lines in his hand
They still point to you

Beethoven's Piano
Shuts up
Only the needle that scratches
Your name in my heart <|endoftext|> 
seven carnations, seven roses
Seven carnations, seven roses
A bridal bouquet for you
Seven carnations, seven roses
I made a very special choice
I who love you so much

Fourteen flowers, fourteen months
The most beautiful in our existence
Fourteen flowers like those months
Which we thought had no end
But you still left

You will now marry another man
Still, I know you can't forget
How we loved each other
Unfortunately the Fairytale never came true
It took a little over a year

Seven carnations, seven roses
A bridal bouquet for you
Seven carnations, seven roses
I made a very special choice
I who love you so much



Fourteen flowers, fourteen months
The most beautiful in our existence
Fourteen flowers like those months
Which we thought had no end
But you still left

You radiate with joy and you smile
Maybe he has brought you luck now
But are you still thinking about me?
The memory stays with you
But that time is over anyway

Seven carnations, seven roses
A bridal bouquet for you
Seven carnations, seven roses
I made a very special choice

Sympathy is not love
but sooner or later maybe
there will come a day that sympathy
will turn into love
sympathy then becomes love
it is only you
give me a sign
when your friendship becomes love
"It makes me very happy
when you smile at me
but I think of other things
every night over and over
I dream more and more
that you love me
sympathy sometimes becomes love
it is only you
give me a sign
when your friendship becomes love
listen to your heart
it sometimes sounds confused
yes, it works like mine
makes you so happy too
then believe me free
that's where love comes from



sympathy then becomes love
it is only you
give me a sign
when your friendship becomes love <|endoftext|> 
the water is much too deep
She is looking through rose-colored glasses
To things she likes
But what she gets, she already has
I get nothing, pray every day
I sit here and I wait
To something that will never come anyway
Just like two kings children
Do we love each other so much

But the water is way too deep
Two people in need
There is no way around it
We have nothing in common
The distance is too great
The water is way too deep
The water is way too deep
I see what she does not see
She doesn't know my world
The water is way too deep

She, she hates what no one hates
Thinks winning is so banal
She's so clever at what she does
I try, it flops
I fall and get up again
But I don't know how to proceed

Just like two kings children
we love each other so much



But the water is way too deep
Two people in need
There is no way around it
We have nothing in common
The distance is too great
The water is way too deep
The water is way too deep
I see what she does not see
She doesn't know my world
The water is way too deep

But the water is way too deep
Two people in need
There is no way around it
We have nothing in common
The distance is too great
The water is way too deep
The water is way too deep
I see what she does not see
She doesn't know my world
The water is way too deep <|endoftext|> 
beautiful women never walk in the shadows
No, beautiful women never walk in the shadows
They have guts and temperament
They are always in the spotlight
Walk in the spotlight
No, you never see them in the shadows
Nothing or no one taming them

It was written in the stars
That she would succeed in everything
She's a winner. She makes a career
And I can't complain

I am rarely forgotten
My name is in her diary
For beautiful women, I know
Is man or job the big dilemma?

No, beautiful women never walk in the shadows
They have guts and temperament
They are always in the spotlight
Walking in the spotlight
No, you never see them in the shadows
Nothing or no one taming them

Sometimes there are days, they are so blissful
Then she flees from life
Then she looks for warmth. She's safe here
I can only give love



But after while she has to call
I know it is never a coincidence
I'm rejoining the bachelorette club
And she, she goes on the attack

No, beautiful women never walk in the shadows
They have guts and temperament
They are always in the spotlight
Walking in the spotlight
No, you never see them in the shadows
Nothing or no one taming them

No, beautiful women never walk in the shade
They have guts and temperament
They are always in the spotlight
Walking in the spotlight
No, you never see them in the shadows
Nothing or no one taming them
No, you never see them in the shadows
A beautiful woman is never tamed <|endoftext|> 
Not to succumb is quicker said than done If a woman of your kind makes me understand very well
One evening by the sea, who would have ever thought this
That the future smiles at us and that you wait
All your life

I feel your skin, I hear your soft breath
With my eyes closed
The pounding of your heart already makes me guess
With my eyes closed
How you want to seduce me
How you would like me
I let myself float on your wild waves
With my eyes half closed

But I didn't know, now I know you would mean it
That you wanted me eagerly forever
That your smile alone told me a thousand things
That you want to enchant me and I want for you
Now will go through a fire

I feel your skin, I hear your soft breath
With my eyes closed
The pounding of your heart already makes me guess
With my eyes closed
How you want to seduce me
How you would like me
I let myself float on your wild waves
With my eyes half closed



How you blinded me so
How you caught me in your nets
I will never regret it
Because what you did made so much sense

I feel your skin, I hear your soft breath
With my eyes closed
The pounding of your heart already makes me guess
With my eyes closed
How you want to seduce me
How you would like me
I let myself float on your wild waves
With my eyes half closed
I let myself float on your wild waves
With my eyes no longer closed <|endoftext|> 
A smile, a greeting, a happy face, a bird floating towards the light, oh it seems so normal, but it's a miracle nonetheless ...

A child smiling and waving at you, a cyclist turning the corner, oh it seems so normal, but it's a miracle nonetheless ...

Life passes so quickly, that goes for you, but also for me ...

Chorus ;
Let the sun in your heart, it shines for everyone anyway, enjoy life, because it only takes a while ...

Let the sun in your heart, it shines for everyone anyway, enjoy life, because it only takes a while ...

The beach, the sea, the full moon, the sky where the stars are, oh it seems so ordinary, but it's a miracle nonetheless ...

And if you are sometimes not in a good mood, think about the smile of a child, yes that makes you happy again, yes that makes you happy again ...



Life passes so quickly, that goes for you, but also for me ...

Chorus...

If you are not happy, if you are sometimes sad, think of the sun and sing this song ...

I always wear a small picture of my girl on my heart
That little picture will guide me
Through good times and bad
Whatever life offers
I'm not forgetting my girl

I feel so alone sometimes
Then I'll write to her immediately
And tell her about my love
I just want her to know
That I never forget her
That I always carry her image with me




A little picture of my girl
I always carry on my heart
That little picture will guide me
Through good times and bad
Whatever life offers
I'm not forgetting my girl

Sometimes the divorce takes a long time
And I get scared for a moment
That she will forget me
But she remains faithful to me
And I quickly repent
That I could think such a thing

A friend sometimes accuses me
To go out with him
And then I always have to refuse
And this is sometimes hard
The photo on my heart
Gives me strength and strength

A little picture of my girl
I always carry on my heart
That little picture will guide me
Through good times and bad
Whatever life offers
I'm not forgetting my girl
I'm not forgetting my girl <|endoftext|> 
No movie on TV
Not in the mood for the café
And I shiver from the cold

The radio continues
But everything I hear
Sounds gray and gray for a moment

Bridge:

I turn, around here, and around, and around, like a lion in a cage
Despair prey

Chorus:



I get lost in the chilly night
Still, I keep watch
But you don't come to me
There is no point in waiting for you
I'll be alone tonight
"I'm slowly getting tired of my life
What did you expect from me?
What would you have thought?
Or what do you want me to do?
Do you still want me to wait for you?
Will I see you tonight?
Are you coming back to me?

Bridge

"I'm bored to death here
My cup is full of scrap metal
And I feel terribly down

You know where I live
I have a phone
But I don't hear from you

Monday I have nothing
I am free on Tuesday
Wednesday I am free from nothing
And you come on Thursday
Friday is you
Saturday is you
And you have to go back on Sunday

Monday I have nothing
I am free on Tuesday
Wednesday I am free from nothing

Four out of seven
"It's a life
the life of me

It will always be Monday again
automatically the day after
then it is only 1 day to go
1 day that I don't exist
but then life begins
my life, four out of seven
four full days
that's quite a lot



Chorus

the dead days
make me feel
what life is for
the living
the four out of seven
that it is about love

tomorrow is Thursday

a person can go to bed early <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes she has something on her mind
I've never believed it that way
Because the same story
I already heard a 1000 x
She has seen it clearly
She says tomorrow might be too late
To ensure a new beginning

And I think: this late again?
There is no time
And today we can no longer

She takes her life out of the closet
She puts her future in a bag
A beautiful day today
Such a beautiful day
She holds me tight again
And then kiss me a 1000 times goodbye



She can do without my singing
She has known the words for a long time
And the plan she has
Don't want my song survived

Then she looks in the closet
And she looks for that one bag
Which is already filled 1000 times for the two of us

And I think: where is that going?
And if you really have to
Then why don't you go alone?

She takes her life out of the closet
She puts her future in a bag
A beautiful day today
Such a beautiful day
She holds me tight again
And then kiss me a 1000 times goodbye <|endoftext|> 
I won't come until you lie down
You are ready for the night
I come in images, in fragments
Hard, suddenly and unexpected

I'll come while you look out the window
From your favorite cafe
I'll be there as soon as you think
I am at peace with it

If you look calmly over the sea
And you think: Now I have peace
Do I have you unexpectedly and gently
Kissed hard on your soul

You call me old grief
Do whatever you want
(but) I'm not that terribly old yet



I prefer to come if you listen
To an unexpectedly beautiful song
I've only come to see it for weeks, months
After the real big grief

I hide in hidden photos
Something you will find under the sofa
And really I'm not drowning
It's easiest to hide in booze

Sometimes I end up laughing
That turns into crying
They are exactly the same tears
Who only swap their names

You call me old grief
Do whatever you want
(but) I'm not that terribly old yet

I prefer to come at night
If you can't sleep
Just then, just then <|endoftext|> 
I only had 1 minute with you
In which I would ask everything again
Because since you're gone
I long for every moment
Even if it was only 1 minute with you

I only had 1 minute with you
In which I would thank you again
Even if I did something stupid, you stayed behind me
I only had 1 minute with you

I only had 1 minute with you
To hear what you think, if I don't know for a moment
When I have doubts about things I see you
That one look or a gesture, our discussions with each other
If only you were here now, just for a while

Then I would bombard you with everything and more
Embracing you firmly again, for the very last time
Just a minute
Just for a moment



I only had 1 minute with you
In which I would tell you again
That there is no day left for me without missing you
I only had 1 minute with you

I only had 1 minute with you
To hear what you think, if I don't know for a moment
When I have doubts about things I see you
That one look or a gesture, our discussions with each other
If only you were here now, just for a while

It was a seven day journey and the nights were long
but I had good company most of the time, and I was rarely afraid
on the other side of the hills, the grass was not always green
I'd be lying if I said I wanted to do it again.

It was at nightfall when the sun was at the horizon
that I found my travel destination at the end of the fields
I had read and heard in a thousand books and stories
of peace in paradise beyond the gates of heaven.

The gate was small and austere, a simple wooden door
in a wall of rough stone and indeterminate color
no halo, no heavenly light, no proudly waving flag
only sign that said: "We are open on the Last Day".

I hesitantly knocked because this was such a moment
to which the great void yawns when you hear that you are not welcome
at the end of a hard journey and tired to the bone
but I would get an answer to the question "who or what is God".

The gate opened and a man with a beard gave me a friendly look
today is your last day, he said, "you can go inside
my name is Peter, you may have heard of me "
of course, I said, "but what I wanted to ask, may I see God for a moment?"

Peter was silent for a moment and looked at me confused
"who are you saying, he asked with a frown, I didn't hear you well"
I said it again and Peter reacted somewhat disturbed
God, he repeated, "I've never heard that name
there is no one with that name behind the gates of heaven ".



And Jesus, I cried desperately and with a tightened throat
I know Jesus, said Peter, but so many are called that
and then Allah, I tried, or Yeah, that may sound familiar
no, I'm sorry, Peter said, but don't think you're not welcome now

I left the gate and went back into the fields
paradise without God made no sense to me at all
after many hours of walking by the light of the sun and moon
I saw a small hut between dahlias and asters.

A hermit, it seemed, an eccentric or a shepherd
and the end of my journey, because behind the hut it went no further
who lives on the border of everything and nothing
an outcast maybe, the devil or something.

I approached the cabin and looked curiously through the window
A couple sat at a table, drinking tea and eating fruit
they beckoned me in and when I was sitting with them
I discovered the sky in the grain of the table top.

There I saw the dust of the ages among the crumbs of breakfast
and the clockless clock of eternity ticked on the wall
the couple smiled at me and said in a low voice:
"welcome to our house, pleasant, we are him".

"You looked for us and you found us, if that is the meaning of your existence
then there is nothing to say and you can go in peace "
I asked: "why are you so anxiously silent about your presence"
they answered, "knowing ends infinity."

"Well, you know, the simple story of the carrot and the horse
finding us is never worth seeking
so go back to paradise because that's where you belong
you will forget what you saw here, so that the peace is not disturbed
but in your mind we are with you there beyond the gates of heaven ”. <|endoftext|> 
Have you seen the migration of the starlings
and the flame of autumn along the canals?
October is cold and maybe even colder
is the wind in the lonely nights.

Come back and don't wait
because winter covers this land.
Come back to my house, in my hand.

The city in the fog is a different city
than that fair with sunny streets
where you first had the feeling then
that you couldn't hate anyone anymore.

Come back and don't wait ...



The night in the ports is full of noise
and the scents of spices and ginger.
An anchor light goes out on the horizon
and the water is cold in December.

Come back and don't wait ...

Oh the plain is gray and the world is old
and I run south along the path.
But too late because a tower of salt is already rising
and for me the bells are ringing now.

Come back and don't wait ... <|endoftext|> 
I have been waiting for you,
but you didn't come to me.
I tried to call you,
you weren't there for me.
But I understand it's over
well I'm sure
But I think it's so strange.

The sun is gone.
Feel a drop here and there.
Oh well that suits me,
because then you won't see my tears.
All my life I've been alone
it never works i keep wondering
What have I done.

Whatever I do,
I will never succeed.
I'm doing something wrong
I see everything fail.
It's been so hard
you are so alone.
I too want warmth
I'm not made of stone.

I can look jealous
to those people on the terrace.
They laugh and drink,
I wish I was there.
But life goes on anyway.
The world will turn
that's all I always hear




Whatever I do,
I will never succeed.
I'm doing something wrong
I see everything fail.
It's been so hard
you are so alone.
I too want warmth
I'm not made of stone.

My whole life,
I stood alone.
Ooh I keep wondering.
WHAT HAVE I DONE!!

Whatever I do,
I will never succeed.
I'm doing something wrong
I see everything fail.
It's been so hard
you are so alone.
I too want warmth
I'm not made of stone.

~. End. ~ <|endoftext|> 
Come on
turn around look at me
no i will not let you go
can't you forgive me
to
it was just a game to me
dry your tears quickly now
I want to live with you
really
I love you so much
I repent now
don't leave me out in the cold

love what is love
forgiveness is also part of love
begging here on my knees
questioning don't leave me alone

really
never again will I make that mistake
I am still married to you
always let it stay that way
whatever, another tells you
I'm really not that bad
they also make mistakes
to
give it another chance
become my last romance
never leave you alone again




love what is love
forgiveness is also part of love
begging here on my knees
questioning don't leave me alone

love what is love
forgiveness is also part of love

love, this is my love
love return my love

ohhhhhhhh lalalalala <|endoftext|> 
When the lights are on
And the rain makes another night gloomy
And you look through the window of a cafe, it is warm there
Are they really happy
For a moment I close my eyes to dream
That I sat inside could warm myself just like her
But to me those are dreams I have no friends
Yes I had them when I earned but they quickly disappeared



Why I did not ask for this
Why do I keep getting chased
No I don't have to live rich
I've already given up on that
What I want is a little understanding
I really don't have to spend any money
You really don't have to give me much
But just let me live again

When it soon starts snowing
And I share my bread with ducks and seagulls
A moment like that makes us warm because then I am not alone
It seems as if they say then
Let them go, there's nothing to explain here
But with these dark days you are really oh so alone
Now let me dream I have no friends
Yes I had them when I earned but they quickly disappeared <|endoftext|> 
Without you I am lost, tell me where you are
I really have so much to give you if you know me better
Give me a chance, I need you
The fact remains
You're right, I was few
Well, not enough time

You're in love, but not with me
Oh that has been taking so long now
Tell me, am I going to lose you
And I am so scared
I want to fight, I want to fight
I want to do everything for you
Do give me a chance my love
Because I love you

refr .:
    Because I love you
    I love you so much
    Because I love you
    I love you so much



I don't want nice words from you
But the beating of your heart
I already lost in advance
With such a bad start
May I ask you one more thing
Or is it really too late
Give me a chance my love
Before you go

refr.

Did you really love me?
Or were you just pretending?
Did you not understand me correctly
Was I too rude sometimes?
I have been given so little time
For some time with you
Give me a chance to prove
How much I love you

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Why, tell me why?
Am I alone and always lonely?
Why, tell me why?
Doesn't anyone even call me by my first name?

I never have a wife.
Who helps me once, or goes out with me.
Why, tell me why?
Do I have to stand alone?

Ah yes, I have my job.
Earn my money, that's my life.
It's all, it's all for me.
But I would love to give something.
As long as I can't do that, I'm not happy.
And stay lonely too.

Why, tell me why?
Do I have to stand alone?
Sit here alone, without a girlfriend.
Where do I go, it makes no sense anyway.



I would love to, believe me.
Want to talk to you, dance in the night.
But those kinds of dreams never come true.
Always stay lonely.

And yet, I still have hope.
Because there is still a tomorrow after all.
And when luck comes.
Then I will always take care of her.
And build a family there.
With which I can spend my life.
Come on, bring me luck.
Preferably tomorrow.

Now I dream it again
am i in love.
Oh dear, say please.
Get close to me, give me a kiss.
I love you, I will.
But dreams like that
never come true.
Always stay lonely. <|endoftext|> 
I walk on the street
my thoughts aren't going anywhere
even today
my birthday
I am alone
nobody sees
that I feel lonely
I just wander on
without plans or purpose

no streamers on the wall for me
no dinner, no restaurant
no gifts no shaking hands
no advertisement in the morning newspaper
people walk side by side
hand in hand they pass
i see love in their eyes
why never with me



a porch
old newspapers that's my house
no open hair
but the heat of a heating pipe
occasionally
I have a job, earn my money
then I buy a bottle and lie here exhausted

Chorus. <|endoftext|>

You're gone now it's over
This is the end it's over
I didn't know you yet you were with me
How many people in the world did you make happy
I never forget the moment when I heard
That you were gone no you weren't with us anymore
I really secretly loved you very much
But I was not alone in that which made me happy

You were very beautiful
You were a woman of life
It doesn't matter what anyone else wrote about you
You have given so much of your life
Why couldn't you live happier

Goodbye goodbye I will save the photos
Yes I bought some leaves for that
Maybe you are in a place where love is much better than that world of mine



You have not been rewarded for what you did
You did so much for other people
You walked there on a minefield and an AIDS patient really didn't bother you

If only you knew how much people love you
And that is not over for the time being
Yes I hope you were able to see from above
To all your friends all those flowers or just to me

You were very beautiful
You were a woman of life
It doesn't matter what anyone else wrote about you
You have given so much of your life
Why couldn't you live happier

Goodbye goodbye I will save the photos
Yes I bought some leaves for that

Did I hear you very well
What have I done to you
You just leave me alone
Was I so mean to you

No you can the last weeks
Me not many by your side
If I ask you have someone else
You pass me

Well you better say it
You relieve that
Come tell me the truth now
And don't bottle it up
Come tell me the truth now
Yes, that really makes sense



Is there someone else in the game?
I don't argue, don't riot
Then I'll let you go
I will forget you from now on

Did I hear you very well
You just leave me alone
What have I done to you
Was I so mean to you
Was I so mean to you <|endoftext|> 
For years you were my gabber
like a brother i loved you.
See you still standing there on the sidewalk,
you were shivering from the cold.
Without a house and without money,
you even lost your wife.
I said live here as long as
but I regret that now.

Chorus:
That's why I helped you out of the gutter
then your friendship was not so great.
How many times were you there in my bed
You never saw your friend's wedding portrait on the wall.
Then nothing really went through you,
are you so poor and so mean.
But everything is over
you took her away from me.
It is a pity,
our friendship is over.

I never asked you a nickel
that you ate with us was normal.
Even if you wanted to walk once
I gave you some of my wages.
You gave everything even my clothes
because a friend will not let you down.
Have you forgotten everything
why did you do this to me



Chorus: (2í—)
That's why I helped you out of the gutter

What a friend yes what a friend you were to me.

Why aren't you here
you know i miss you so much
What's going on in you
you're another woman

You're so blurry and quiet
you don't say a word
Tell me what it is
maybe I can still save what you're missing

It's no longer a shadow
of our life, how it was,
You left home
without case, without bag,

You're so blurry and quiet
you don't say a word
I can not live without you,
don't you wanna talk once, please



The world is spinning for you
you still belong

You're so blurry and quiet
you don't say a word
Tell me what it is
Enjoy, it will be over in no time

You're so blurry and quiet
you don't say a word
Tell me what it is
come talk to me one more time
With me. <|endoftext|> 
verse
Sometimes I think to my own
what do I do with this again
They can get it back and forth
it's never right it's always no

But I've already watched it
today that will be my day
That I am going to enjoy life
and everything is possible and allowed
Chorus:
Ooh tonight I'm going to go crazy
Throw everything off me and fill me up
Because I love life
although sometimes I also have to give
but tonight the fun counts only for me

Ooh I put my worries aside for a moment
And do not think of grief or concern
yeah laugh howl roar
let's fill my glass
because tonight I'm going to go crazy

verse:
You have to enjoy life
don't care about someone else
because he always knows better
but let them look at their own



Chorus

You have to enjoy life
don't care about someone else

Chorus <|endoftext|> 
Had I not said it, you will come back to me
Had I not said it, I always released you
You let us know where you've been
I can guess that
But I don't care
Well, you're back with me
What should I whine about
After rain the sun will shine again
I knew you would come back to me

refr .:
    Now you lie with me again between my arms
    I caress you through your hair, you are sleeping
    My heart is pounding in my throat, you know that
    How I missed you, how much did you miss me
    Now you lie with me again between my arms
    Would like to warm you forever
    Ah, I knew you thought in all your dreams
    I have to get out of that world, I want to go back to you



Had I not said it, life passes
Had I not said it, you will share that with me later
I have to tell you honestly, I am so happy with you
I appreciate you so much, especially as a woman
You have the right to prove your own
And to praise yourself
But let me share everything with you
Then the world doesn't care anymore

refr. <|endoftext|> 
You are young and beautiful but you are not sincere
Because I read love in your eyes
Your lips whispered words of loyalty
They both cheated on me

Two lips so red that you offered me so often
Is over because you forgot me
Two eyes so blue full of promise of loyalty
Is over because you forgot me
Now another kisses the mouth who said to me
You are the happiness and the life for me
Two lips so red that you offered me so often
Gone is gone forever

Now another kisses the mouth who said to me
You are the happiness and the life for me



Two lips so red that you offered me so often
Gone is gone forever <|endoftext|> 
I was enjoying the sun this afternoon
and thought how it all started
I sang a song about Christmas
and that just became a hit
from one thing to another I was an artist like that

I was suddenly next to poksie pokstrot
that became my boyfriend nicolaak
I saw a horse standing in the hallway
It was dré van duin's horse
still feel the belly of demi's roesos
who drank even better than me
and the photo, with kootjak I will not forget

a terrace a chair there I am now alone
I still thought I can't go anywhere else now
but I saw so many moments then, I was really not alone anymore
because cornelis willie alberti sjonnie orba

Stop, you really have to stop now
Because if you continue like this
Then you might be really late
Learn, now you have to learn
That there are also nice things
Maybe you don't understand yet
What I want to say to you
You don't say a word
You are always so quiet

refr .:
   Please come with me
   Why are you saying no again
   This is not life like that
   It is a waste of your time
   Have a laugh at me
   You are free with me
   It is pointless what you do now
   Listen to me



Live without friends and love
If I knew what hurt you
Then I can still help, oh my darling
Tell me oh come on now tell me
I rectify what went wrong
Maybe you don't understand yet
What I want to tell you
You don't say a word
You are always so quiet

I already gave you up anyway
what I heard was still low

don't play with fire because
it is you who will soon be burning
do not play with fire as that will cost you dear
don't play with fire I can do much better than you
did you think you could just walk over me

You walk with me when I go down the street at night
You also look up into the infinite universe
Like me, you can smell the wood fire in the gardens
And the damp leaves now that autumn falls so early
Do you hear the wind chasing the shadows?
Clouds past the moon howls and trees undressed
Do you also hear memories of it
all those little things about you and me
You and me, that you will never forget

You are my spring, you are my summer
And when I look back you are there
But dear God look at us
How early autumn falls this year

Will you walk with me when I hang out at night?
Along the houses where we lived in those days
Can you see the lights still burning there?
Were we others then and have we now lost them
Can you still hear the voices of our children?
They grew up, you don't know how soon
But what I miss in my memories
about all those young things about you and me
Me and you when did we get old

You are my spring, you are my summer
And when I look back you are there
But dear god look at us
How early autumn falls this year



Will you walk with me when I get up in the evening?
Do you look ahead into the infinite universe
Take your hand full of falling leaves
Do you already see the new earth in it?

You are my spring, you are my summer
And when I look back you are there
But dear God look at us
How early autumn falls this year
But dear God look at us
Autumn is so beautiful this year <|endoftext|> 
It seemed like summer already, but it was only the end of May
A day of which you think "it will not pass anymore"
My friends came over but I just wanted
Walking on the beach, just nowhere to go

Then I saw you, you called me with your eyes
I looked at you and got a strange feeling
Because I understood what you wanted to ask me
Come closer to me

I was sixteen and you were twenty-eight
And I didn't know much about love yet
But I understood what you wanted to say to me
I was no longer a child
And it came summer (summer)



You were so free, I thought it was a bit weird at first
You wore nothing but your long blonde hair
I was shy and didn't know what to do
I just stood there looking, oh how green I felt
"I understand", I heard you say
You're so young and you don't know what to do
Don't worry, the night will teach you
Come closer to me

We walked along the beach together
And like a boy I took your hand
But as a man I saw the sun rise again
And it came summer (summer)
It was summer (summer)

Summer was coming, for the first time in my life
It was summer, the very first time
And I was a man when the sun came up again
And it came summer (summer)
And summer came
Then it was summer <|endoftext|> 
I heard a moving song
That David wrote and what God loved
But you say that now my song can't fascinate you
It starts very softly in the minor key
 to G and A to et major

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

Your faith was strong but something was missing
I saw you bathing on the roof
Your beauty and the moonlight flow together
But you tied me to a lamp post
You broke my crown and you shaved me
And from my mouth you stole the Hallelujah.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

Maybe I only understood later
That you were never really mine
We couldn't bloom together on my soil
And now you already crow victory
Love is a whole different song
It's a cold and a broken Hallelujah.


 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.



There was a time in the beginning
That you let me inside
But now I can't interfere with you anymore
I remember how you took me in, the sky came down
Took my breath away in one word Hallelujah.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

Maybe I misread the book
But everything I've learned
Is how love can ruin your life
Oh it's not passion in the night
Not a white pigeon waiting for you
But a cold and a broken Hallelujah.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. <|endoftext|> 
I feel it in my fingers
feel it from head to toe
love came in waves
I can't ignore it

It's written in the wind
It should have been like this
for you and me
so if you really love me
then show it to me

open your arms
and allow me
feel in your heart
what I feel for you
there is no way back
there is no end
my love for you
will be endless

I'll see you in a minute
here in this bed with me
o my dreams turn circles
for everything you they



I have given my word
you don't know half how
i pray that you stay with me
in everything I do
do what i do

open your arms
and allow me
feel in your heart
what I feel for you
there is no way back
there is no end
my love for you
will be endless
will be endless

It's written in the wind
It should have been like this
so if you really love me
loves me
then show it to me

then show it to me
if you really love me
then show it to me
show it
if you really love me <|endoftext|> 
Here I have a photo from a long time ago
But if I keep watching it will be present again
Taken on the morning of my fifth birthday
The room full of streamers, the present already waiting
The skipper's keyboard, the wish of my dreams
I took it to the circus in the afternoon
And becoming a firefighter was the goal of life
Those dreams are over, the feeling has remained

refr .:
Deep in my heart I often long for that child back
Children want to be big, well that goes quickly
When life is against me, I think about that time
Although I never became that firefighter, the child did not get lost

Yet everything seemed very simple, no worries no doubt
Good and evil came from God from the Devil
The clock on the wall was there purely for the beauty
I had plenty of time to roam around the neighborhood
A sea was a ditch, my clog was a boat
And death was like my grandma's pussy
The world was no bigger than Father's globe
I can turn it on its axis with my little finger



refr

Being alone or lonely how could I know that
I just had to run home
With a hole in my head and my pants full of rips
My mom was home so what could happen to me

When life is against me, I think about that time
Although I never became an Ivanhoe, I did not lose the child <|endoftext|> 
I don't have to look out the window
Because nothing passes here
Maybe a stray swan
A flock of geese side by side
And the world down there
Is gray and vague and deep
And I know you wouldn't hear it
when I called
And I polar bear across my room
In my ivory tower
And wait for the morning and the sun
And I give you sweet names
You can no longer hear
And which I didn't give when you could hear it

Nothing like you at all
Lidwientje Walg
Although it also towers above everything
The clouds float over well
Lidwientje Walg

From east to west
From north to south
Although this towers above it
Nothing like you at all
Lidwientje Walg



Although you won't find me downstairs anymore
I think things, very lofty things about you
And scatter the words on the wind outside
Lidwientje Walg
Lidwientje Walg
Lidwientje ...

A thunderstorm, a rainbow
The sun comes out in the morning
Maybe someday I'll see Hamelin, cause I'm high
high enough
And in my white room
I have the rich alone
And think how soft your arms are around me
Together And I polar bear across my room
In my ivory tower
And wait for the morning and the sun
And I give you sweet names
You can no longer hear
And which I didn't give when you could hear it

Nothing like you at all
Lidwientje Walg
I scream above all the clouds
Even if you wouldn't believe it
Lidwientje Walg

I shout it out loud
North to South
A whole sky full of sound
Nothing like you at all
Lidwientje Walg
Although you won't find me downstairs anymore
I think things, very lofty things about you
And scatter the words on the wind outside

Girlfriend of mine, dear friend,
They never understand me when I start like this
Girlfriend, I'm not sure either
what to call your friend who is a woman.

And nobody believes me and yet it is true
we've never had anything with each other
Girlfriend of mine you are always again
just a girlfriend and a little bit more
(and a little bit more girlfriend, girlfriend) (2X)

I was in town with a bunch of people
there was a lady who I liked
we all sat on a terrace
I just told her how nice she was
And then suddenly you jumped on my lap
the table turned, the confusion was great
You started to kiss me wonderfully
the beer was in everyone's hair and shoes.

Girlfriend of mine, there you were again
a dear friend and a little bit more,
I was under you and under the beer
that nice lady had no fun.
Hypocritical! you had nothing to do with her
you are together all the time.
Girlfriend of mine, you make it again
because you are just that little bit more

(and a little more girlfriend, girlfriend) (4X)

But you were the one who did something
when the rest threw me nicely into the street.
I broke down, was this far gone
They thought, he will make it on his own
Of course someone with so much sorrow
that is not such a nice company
and then I also got to hear,
don't pretend, you can take it
Nana, nana, nana, nana,



You put me in a bath, you put me in bed
the morning after you made coffee.
I slept in your arms that one time
and then you were just that little bit more.

What you don't understand is of course again
that we are friends and a little bit more.
Friends and sometimes a little bit more
and sometimes a VERY little bit more.

A little more, a little more

and a little bit more girlfriend, girlfriend ......... <|endoftext|> 
Have a drink from me
I do not know you
and I have nothing to say to you.
There is nothing to explain.
But there is something that binds us
whatever you think of it.
It's a fact
and I just wanted to say that.

Here's your glass
you do not know me
and you don't have to know me.
But I myself have to get used to it
because there is something that separates us
of happiness and tenderness.
It's a woman
neither of us wanted.

So have a drink, beer or wine,
because we are who we are after all.
And the world is small
and there we are in the cold.



Next time you offer me something
and keep talking for a while.
Oh you can take it easy
but you loved her too
and that binds us together.
It does hurt,
but so it should be.

So have a drink ...

Have a drink ... <|endoftext|> 
I heard clear singing
one night along the beach.
At the edge of the tide line
a mermaid lay in the sand.
When I got closer
lured by her singing
I saw tears in her eyes
satin pearls on her cheek.

She said:
I want to get out of the chilly water
living on the land
living with you on the land.

She had pepper blonde hair
slightly frivolous in the wind.
She was staring straight ahead
and had the features of a child.
She seemed woven from plankton
and she gave life to the water.
I went along desperately
with the queen of the sea.

She said:
I want to get out of the chilly water
living on the land
living with you on the land.



The dream then broke to pieces
and about midnight
saw a roamer on the beach
in the pale yellow moonlight
a circle of dead fish
in the sand.
Where a black rose was clutched
in the print of a hand.

I want to get out of the chilly water
living on the land
living with you on the land. <|endoftext|> 
Half past three in the morning, is it that late already?
he hurries to his car on a deserted street.
Raindrops on the forward, a storm is in the sky, fleeing a motel, the usual way back

And the thunder rolls ... and the thunder rolls ...

All the lights are on in a house far away, she is waiting at the telephone with her father's sister on.
If only she could believe she's mistaken, and that it's a storm that he's not there yet.

And the thunder rolls ... and the thunder rolls ...



And the thunder rolls ... and the lightning cracks,
and love burns where it is hit ...
and the storm rages on ... the measure is full.
deep in her heart ... where the thunder rolls.

Ee is already at the front door as he drives up the path, throwing herself into his arms all her fear and regret.
But a strange perfume floats in the wind, a scent that sticks to him.
lightning lights her eyes and he knows she knows ...

And the thunder rolls ... and the thunder rolls ...

And the thunder rolls, the lightning crackles,
and love burns where it is touched ...
and the storm rages on ... the measure is full.
deep in her heart ... where the thunder rolls.

Rob de Nijs- Time is standing still


Time stands still,
When I think of you… ..

My friends know so well.
They have wipes for the blood.
And red wine for every tear.
As long as I didn't go back.
Because every step towards you hurts.
You're there, but you can't be like I once knew you.
So you screamed, at one moment
Time stands still,
When I think of you, when I think of you

Just one moment, only with you, only with you.
You said I don't recognize you, you said I'm going to get used to it.
Holding you in my arms, hungry, hungry in my heart.
So intense that I didn't know anything anymore and now when I suddenly miss you.
Stops panting in front of the mirror, a pose under the cold tap.
Time stands still,
When I think of you, when I think of you
Oh you don't know, you drive by, you don't know what it did to me.

My friends know so well.
They have wipes for the blood.
And red wine for every tear.
As long as I don't go back….

And time stands still
When I think of you, when I think of you
Stolen time, alone with you, alone with you




Time stands still <|endoftext|> 
I turned five that summer
that my parents were going to travel.
I'd take care of the house
of course I had to prove myself.
And it was as if it went by itself
when I took you.

In the west became heaven
violet above the dunes.
And there was a strange silence
over pine forest and gardens.
And I saw something in your eyes
that made me so insecure.
And we looked down
and your hand was in mine
just like a thousand years ago.
And you asked:
will you stay with me
when it gets dark?

At first everything was equally beautiful,
but you soon learn to get used to it,
and you didn't stay the girl long
that I would have liked to know.
Now more and more cold suspicion is coming
and more distance in your eyes.
Your face loses its softness
and your mouth the tender arches.



And we have one night
beaten mean for the first time
and then there was silence,
full of unspoken questions.
You stay with me
when it gets dark?

Maybe some summer will come
that we're over everything
maybe for both of us together,
maybe we'll be alone.
But we will know each other
and know how to adapt.
Unhappy or happy,
anyway.

When we're under heaven again
then we say goodbye
or we keep going together
and then it is forever.
But we know what we did
and your hand is in mine
just like a thousand years ago.
You stay with me
when it gets dark? <|endoftext|> 
Diplomas hang on the wall,
my bed is spread.
I no longer have my freedom,
only free time.
It's not going well and it's not going bad
it goes in between.
But I don't want to get away from life
I want to be in the middle of it.

Goodbye dearest of my heart,
I'm saying goodbye now.
I wanted to go to heaven with you
but you chose hell yourself.
I'm sorry dear papa in law
I thank you very much.
The house you gave us
came straight from Avenue.

Goodbye father and goodbye mother,
goodbye Sister Ursula.
I don't see it here
I'm going to America.
Goodbye father and goodbye mother,
goodbye Sister Ursula.
I don't see it here
I'm going to America.



Goodbye dear rest of the Netherlands,
goodbye dear everyone.
Just sit still
in the Land of Maas and Waal.
I can only laugh
I get out, I go
my backpack and my tent,
chasing the butterflies.

Goodbye father and day mother ...

Goodbye father and day mother ... <|endoftext|> 
The boss's daughter next door
has eyes like the high seas
and I want to go on those waves
because her smile amazes me.
The balls on the green billiards
hit ticking, it's ten past red.
And I stare at her heart in silence
and see her slowly expose pink.

Beer is bitter,
beer is good,
beer is better than the rest.
Beer is bitter,
beer is good,
beer is better than the rest.

The regular guys scratch out
and football predominates.
It's as if I've lived here for years.
The waiter gives the last joke
and the TV without sound
silently shows murder and manslaughter.
It seems far behind that window
but tomorrow it might come here.



Beer is bitter ...

I sit here last and drink
and evoke the old dreams.
And with my shovel shovel
I slide the holes into the zinc.
I stroke her bare soft arm
and get one last glass in exchange.
Maybe it will be warm again tomorrow
and I walk outside without a coat.

Beer is bitter ...

Beer is bitter ... <|endoftext|>

    Di-di-diana how could I know you were crazy about me
    And that you read all my letters so many times
    I didn't know any better because I was green as grass
    Di-di-diana, I don't really know what to do about this anymore
    That's why I'm singing this song now, you might forget your grief

There I was, I didn't know what would happen to me
The band broke up, suddenly I saw you there
You asked me that one question, my answer was no
Believe me, I like you even though I didn't go with you

Di-di-di-di

[with Marianne Weber]

F: I've been looking for so long
M: To happiness
F: It seemed like a closed book
M: Everything broke down
F: But far from here
M: I saw you
F: You got out of my dream
M: I joined Chorus:

Those summer nights in San José
the sun, the beach and the sea
I took it as a nice souvenir
in dreams
Those summer nights in San José
they brought us together
At 1000 stars and full moon
our dream finally came true



F: You asked me to come
M: That time was great
F: You left me anyway
M: That loneliness
F: But one day I'll come again
M: Back here with me
F: One day you will be in front of me again
M: My greatest happiness

Those summer nights in San José
the sun, the beach and the sea
I took it as a nice souvenir
in dreams
Those summer nights in San José
they brought us together
At 1000 stars and full moon
our dream finally came true

The road of life, sometimes it is not easy but there is always light somewhere
You often have to give something carries water to the sea, then every door is closed for you
Don't forget to live because once the day comes you will no longer be alone
Believe in yourself, so take every opportunity to get over it

refr .:
    As long as you can dream of happiness, stars shine for you too
    The day will soon come for you when someone loves you
    As long as you can dream of happiness, tears are useless
    Just look into the mirror of life



Even though people say, you are not doing it well, but you do not care much about it
Walk the roads as you do, as long as you stand still
With trial and error, a laugh and a tear, life is a carousel
You run faster and faster, but hold on tight
Life is always a game

refr. (2x)

Just look into the mirror of life <|endoftext|> 
I haven't seen you in a while
I read your letters about ten times
A picture of you is on the wall here
But I would prefer to see you again

Although I know, you live far from me
But today, I will really be here for you
From now on our love knows no limit
I'm coming now

refr .:
    I'll take the last train
    Because I want to be with you tonight
    This journey full of amor
    It leaves today by rail
    On the way to happiness
    I'll take the last train
    So that I can be very close to you
    Wait for me on the platform
    Because you are my final destination
    Yes, my greatest happiness



It will take a while before I go
But soon I will travel after my dreams
Desires for you often hurt so much
Because I couldn't be with you

I'm already saying goodbye to my house
You will now also be my home
I long for the best moment
I'm with you

refr.

Wait for me on the platform
Because you are my final destination
Yes, my greatest happiness <|endoftext|> 
Walking together on the white beach
And in the distance the bouzouki's are playing
We write our names in the sand
The full moon shining on your face

Fourteen days as the most beautiful couple
Time has flown too quickly
I look in your eyes on your cheek I see a tear
Because I had to leave again

refr .:
    Ciao, goodbye my love, arrivederci
    I have to go because this summer is over
    I will never forget this holiday again
    The memory that always stays with me
    Ciao, goodbye my love, arrivederci
    In my heart you are my most beautiful souvenir
    I have to go back, but I will never forget you
    I have to go back, but I will never forget you
    Away from you, but I leave my thoughts here
    Away from you, but I leave my thoughts here



Know I'll be coming here again next year
I only have you now to dream of
You kept asking me why
I leave you there in solitude

But this goodbye also saddens me
Love will really conquer everything
Our last words, no, I will not forget them
I hope to see you again soon

refr. <|endoftext|> 
I look deep into your eyes your smile, you don't know what I feel
They have never cheated on me before, you give me that warm feeling
Your voice doesn't have to tell me much
A word sounds like a song to me
You don't have to make me look at anything with you, my heart knows no sorrow

refr .:
    I pick the most beautiful red roses for you
    When I see you I think again and again
    I am so glad you chose my love
    Because I will never find a woman like you again



I dream even though you are close to me, I dream every hour of the day
I dream that you will stay with me because you are my tear and my smile

refr. (2x)

Because I will never find a woman like you again <|endoftext|> 
Frans Bauer - Then I'll bring you roses

Sometimes I am far from you for days
I have that sad feeling
Then it is as if time stands still
although I know you feel it too
I count the hours, now they go so slow
but they also pass away
Soon we will be together, therefore today
a holiday for both of us

Then I'll bring you roses
to forget all those tears
I want to let you know with this
my love only counts for you
Then I'll bring you roses
although I don't have to explain anything to you
But still I want to tell you with this
that I love you



I have a wish and you know it about me
that I don't have to leave
Never again that goodbye that is over
We can handle life
There is no other way, you still need some time
although love has little patience
But one day the day will come when your heart is set free
and that our wish be fulfilled

Then I'll bring you roses
to forget all those tears
I want to let you know with this
my love only counts for you
Then I'll bring you roses
although I don't have to explain anything to you
But still I want to tell you with this
that I love you

Then I'll bring you roses
to forget all those tears
I want to let you know with this
my love only counts for you
Then I'll bring you roses
although I don't have to explain anything to you
But still I want to tell you with this
that I love you
But still I want to tell you with this
that I love you <|endoftext|> 
sometimes the smile has left you,
and the sun no longer shines,
then find a friend to talk to,
words that won't hurt you,
tomorrow everything will be different again,
you suddenly see that smile again,
then the sun will also shine,
and you look happy again at the day,


refr:
that's what Friends Are For,
who embrace you
they pull you through
if it doesn't work,
that's what Friends Are For,
for all your life,
because a true friend,
is always ready,




do you hide your tears
do you think no one sees them
you fight only with your worries,
friends who see your sorrow,
you can share everything with them,
any time of the day,
but oh well they don't care
they prefer to see you with a smile,


refr:
that's what Friends Are For,
who embrace you
they pull you through
if it doesn't work,
that's what Friends Are For,
for all your life,
because a true friend,
is always ready, <|endoftext|> 
Blue Spanish eyes
I take you forever in my dreams
Blue Spanish eyes
Once there is also a future for the two of us
Blue Spanish eyes
When I go later, don't shed a tear for me
I'll be back someday
You know I would rather not have gone now



Blue Spanish eyes
Your eyes shine like the starlight
Blue Spanish eyes
Words you say to me are a poem
Blue Spanish eyes
Wait here for me, I will remain faithful to you forever
I'll be back someday
Then I will never leave, I will stay with you

Blue Spanish eyes
Farewell comes too soon for both of us
Blue Spanish eyes
It was two weeks, but not enough
Blue Spanish eyes
Now dry those tears, even if I have to go
I'll be back someday
I will keep dreaming far from you
I will keep dreaming far from you <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes I think what I'm doing wrong now that you say you have to go
We have learned so much together, let the happiness stand us now
If I didn't give you enough love, were you used to it differently
But I can't be here now without you, I hope you'll still be here soon

Will you stay with me tonight? Don't leave me here alone now
I want to talk to you or is it over are you really getting rid of me?
I want to tell you I'm sorry for everything, no I never want to lose you again
Will you stay with me tonight or is it really over?



Are you looking for freedom and you don't want it anymore, I did everything anyway
Tell me honestly, I keep asking what went wrong
Yesterday you said my love, but did you ever mean that?
It's just words, but it hurts a lot
But it will someday be different

Will you stay with me tonight? Don't leave me here alone now
I want to talk to you or is it over are you really getting rid of me?
I want to tell you I'm sorry for everything, no I never want to lose you again
Will you stay with me tonight or is it really over? <|endoftext|> 
Chorus:
Stay awhile
I do not want you to go
I can not live
Here without you
Stay awhile
It is long overdue
The night is lonely
So chilly and cold

Whenever you say you have to go again later
I get that sad feeling
I want to beg you, look at me
I wonder what you feel
Are you unsure and want to go home
I'll give you time
I want to let you know, you are at home here too
Now forget that uncertainty.

Chorus



Everything is different if you are not here
The night has no end
I feel like a stranger ... in my own house
If you disappear again in a minute

Chorus

The night is lonely
So chilly and cold <|endoftext|> 
refr .:
    Stay with me tonight
    Even if only briefly
    I want your warmth
    Close around me
    Stay with me tonight
    Come into my life
    Without your love
    Am I alone

I check the clock, it's late
Know that you will go that way too
Soon that chill in the house
If only I had a little more time

I fight with that empty feeling
Don't you feel what I feel
Tell me you're not going yet
Because once you will regret it



refr.

If you want to think
And requires a little more time
Then know that I am waiting
I don't want to lose Joe

refr.

Without your love
Am I alone <|endoftext|> 
As long as there is still a dream
Which betrays every silent wish
A great happiness awaits somewhere

As long as the sun is still shining for you
And every cloud disappears
There is always a blue sky

Even if it is dark it will be light again
Close the book that is finished
A tear that leaves your heart

That's a reason for a laugh
That way you enjoy the day
As long as there is a dream

As long as there is still a dream

Which betrays every silent wish



As long as there is still a dream

As long as there is still a dream
Which betrays every silent wish
A great happiness awaits somewhere

As long as the sun is still shining for you
And every cloud disappears
There is always a blue sky

Even if it is dark it will be light again
Close the book that is finished
A tear that leaves your heart
That's a reason for a laugh
That way you enjoy the day

As long as there is a dream <|endoftext|>

I see you standing there
my heart beats faster.
You made me live again
I was alone so often, had no one around me
and you came ... the loneliness disappeared

Come into my arms, I'll never let you go, I'll take you on a journey in all my dreams.
Come into my arms, you belong only to me because I love you, my ideal woman

Nothing can go wrong now, because you bring me happiness.
Nobody can stop us now.
Love letter from you I carry very close to me.
The loneliness is now gone forever.



Come into my arms, I'll never let you go, I'll take you on a journey in all my dreams.
Come into my arms, you belong only to me because I love you, my ideal woman

Come into my arms, I'll never let you go, I'll take you on a journey in all my dreams.
Come into my arms, you belong only to me because I love you, my ideal woman

Come into my arms, I'll never let you go, I'll take you on a journey in all my dreams.
Come into my arms, you belong only to me because I love you, my ideal woman <|endoftext|>

You were the guy who had conquered me.
You were the hunter, I was the prize.
Still, I wasn't enough for you.
I don't need you, no, don't sit down and hope.
You no longer determine where I go, what I do and what I leave.

You can't forget how you walk, your sleeves up. Anyway you have to get out of my head and out of my life.

You called, I came
I gave, you took it all.
You're begging for new beginnings again
But honey it makes no sense.
I know I bitch, but what you do is not normal. You're begging for new beginnings, but honey, it's no use.



I was your girl after all
You remain in my memory.
The man where I could be myself.
It's finally over
You have to promise me
Don't come after me
It's too late now.

You can't forget how you walk, your sleeves up. Anyway you have to get out of my head and out of my life.

You called, I came
I gave, you took it all.
You're begging for new beginnings again
But honey it makes no sense.
I know I bitch, but what you do is not normal. You're begging for new beginnings, but honey, it's no use.

I was your girl after all.

All those moments
That we experience
They say goodbye ...
So tough for the two of us

Always that desire
To give something
Even though I know ...
Once we are together



Because love gives me wings
So I'm looking for a little wind
Who will find the way to you at such a moment

Chorus:
When I'm floating on clouds
On the way to you
Experience the most beautiful dream
Only yours
Then the day lasts so long
Before I see you
And I only have you
In my fantasy
Then time will pass for us
So slow over
But tonight love ....
I set you free
Then the heat will
The two of us embrace
And that feeling already makes me happy

Because love gives me wings
So I'm looking for a little wind
Who will find the way to you at such a moment <|endoftext|> 
It's a long journey to being a parent
And if you are big, you like to be small again
You often think back quickly to all those wonderful childhood years
Even if you still have the best photo album, but that memory is often lost
Yet there is one thing you will never forget about the love you received from your parents

refr .:
    Thank you for having my crib with you
    Thank you for life and for my existence
    Thank you for the love I received from you
    And for all your concerns, thank you for living
    And for all your concerns, thank you for living



As a child you think there is always something, I am tired of nagging my parents
And do you have to go to bed early again one evening or your mother asks you to make coffee
Then it may not be easy although you know better yet you say no
Then the day comes, then you are grown and you know that you enjoyed those times

refr. (2x) <|endoftext|> 
Staring at your picture
Waiting what you are going to say
Those hours seem like days without an end
My world changing
If you really leave me now
Then I know that the sun no longer shines either
All your love, so many words say it
You love me
The future was like a castle in the air

refr .:
    When you go, know I'm waiting for you
    Without you, I wander through the night alone
    You can see my tears
    You might come back here one day
    If you go, know that my heart is bleeding here
    Although this farewell is not permanent



I still have so many questions
But I don't get an answer
Then why did I really do something wrong
Those years of ours together
They don't count at once
What is the reason you want to go now
All your love, so many words say it
You love me
The future was built like a castle in the sky

refr.

Although this farewell is not permanent <|endoftext|> 
I stare out the window for hours
Wait if you will come
Although weeks have already passed
But I still keep dreaming
Wherever I am, I keep hearing your name
Keep seeing the thoughts in front of you
Can't yet understand why you
Gone away

refr .:
    When night falls again
    I feel that chill again
    It's cold without you here in the house
    That lonely silence
    No more of you anywhere
    No future dream on which I build

I've lost you, come on, where are you now



The world, life and a smile
Is so much different now
The tears you brought me
They changed me
My life, I now live from day to day
Although I still wait every moment
That one day you will be here again for me
Door will stand

refr.

I've lost you, come on, where are you now
I've lost you, come on, where are you now <|endoftext|>

Staring through the attic window
to heaven realm
talk to your friends
who looks at you smiling
he knows every dream of yours
you ask him for advice
you wait expectantly
what awaits you

Chorus:
1000 stars shine
and a light shines on you
always follow the path of your dreams
1000 stars shine
they are all there for you
and they let you know that happiness still exists

if you believe in yourself
there is always hope
if things go wrong
then don't run away
look through the attic window again
although it feels equally bad
but the moon smiles at you
it told you

I already know what's to come
And my God how hard it is
It's really unstoppable now
Sand in my heart
I'll sit down tonight
And do all the wrong things
Drink me all over
To be able to sing the blues
Yeah, all right

It usually comes when things go well
It usually comes after the intoxication
At every start of every success
Scour the sand off old blues
It's too great a sum
From pain through months
Walked on for way too long
Far too long and too alone



I'll sit down for the blues
Sand in my heart
I sit down for blues

And then I sit down again
Then I'll just force it
With lots of booze and dead pictures
And sing bad songs
And drink for those tears
Who have waited too long
I have to drown the pain now
Tonight is now or never

I'll sit down for the blues
Sand in my heart
I'll sit down for the blues
Sit down for the blues
sand in my heart
I must die, but not die
Twice as hard
Sand in my heart <|endoftext|> 
How much sorrow has he hidden in himself
Every mistake has determined its life
Fight for tomorrow's happiness today
there is not a tear that ever paid this price

What remains are beautiful dreams
In which I will still be fine
but he also knows deep inside
It is too late for his happiness

Feels more trapped in life
Even a smile has brought him nothing
The feeling of continuing makes him more scared
He disappears no one misses him this night



What remains are beautiful dreams
In which I will still be fine
but he also knows deep inside
For his luck it is too late

What remains are beautiful dreams
In which I will still be fine
but he also knows deep inside
It is too late for his happiness <|endoftext|> 
I'm going to have a good roll with you tonight

away from all the hassle, today is a day
to really enjoy and shine with a smile
I'm going to have a good time with you tonight

I've been looking forward to this day all week
away from the grind together
you really don't get me happier
what a night, honey, this is
everyone good mood and no hassle

How beautiful you are, with your tight skirt on
so it is a party, a night out with you.
I'm not looking at the clock, come on baby take another sip
what have we done well together

I'm going to have a good roll with you tonight
forget my worries for a moment, it's now long live the fun
away from all the hassle, today is a day
to really enjoy and shine with a smile
I'm going to have a good time with you tonight

People are laughing, oh, this is a beautiful atmosphere
with drinks on and on, it just can't stop
the bartender plays the most beautiful records, everyone sings along
he turns the whole tent upside down



and me, I just keep dancing with the most beautiful woman
those ones I love very much for most of my life
no lack of love, you still drive me crazy
Oh what a wonderful time I am having with you

Yes such an evening to be in love with you.

Yes such an evening to be in love with you. <|endoftext|> 
In the evening you leave me alone
Don't have anyone around me
I smelled my last cigarette
Then I go to bed alone

My thoughts hurt so much.
Where will you be tonight.
It's already two in the morning.
And I waiting for you

You think you can do anything with me
I'm in a cage here, and you're free.
How stupid I am to wait.
Yes I always wait all night
You think you can do anything with me
But that will be over for good after tonight
A lie has won over loyalty
What kind of woman are you

I look at the wallpaper aimlessly
Wait for your footstep in the hallway
The clock accompanies my silent grief
You don't understand what I feel



Have I done something wrong sometimes?
Can we go on like this?
It's like you blaming me for something
I'm so insecure

 You think you can do anything with me
I'm in a cage here, and you're free.
How stupid I am to wait.
Yes I always wait all night
You think you can do anything with me
But that will be over for good after tonight
A lie has lost allegiance
What kind of woman are you

Accordion solo

You think you can do anything with me
But that will be over for good after tonight
A lie has won over loyalty
What kind of woman are you <|endoftext|> 
I hate you but I love you
I don't want to see you, and yet I miss you
Why are you acting like that?

You laugh, but you don't mean it
I'm sad, but you don't see that
I feel so lonely

I want to leave you alone
Then my worries are gone
But I don't want to, I don't want to let you go

There will be a day for me
To which I sing and laugh again
And that I am happy again

Because I really can't live without you
I am and will always remain faithful to you
Don't let me down, don't leave me out in the cold



The rain is ticking on the attic window
It's so strange how to proceed
I think about you so often
The clouds slide gently past
I hear music, but that's not for me
My heart screaming for you
When will that time come, and if you give me that certainty, come and tell me, I don't want to lose you either

There will be a day for me
To which I sing and laugh again
And that I am happy again

Because I really can't live without you
I am and will always remain faithful to you
Don't let me down, don't leave me out in the cold

There will be a day for me
To which I sing and laugh again
And that I am happy again

Because I really can't live without you
I am and will always remain faithful to you
Don't let me down, don't leave me out in the cold

Don't let me down, don't leave me out in the cold <|endoftext|> 
I came one night
Way late home from a job
I immediately felt something was wrong here
I was not comfortable
There was no note, but there was a wine bottle and a half-full glass
You feel it right away when it happens
I already knew then that she was no longer there

Ref:
I want to do everything for it
That she comes back, that she loves me like then
I want to give her everything
Much more than my life
As long as she's with me
I want to do everything for it
That she longs for me and I long for her as then
I know she makes me happy
Touches me deep down
My great love is, my great love



I will call
Only today no I don't dare to do that yet
I'm so scared she'll tell me
Me a lot of grief
Then I'll say I made a big mistake
I love her so much and I'm sorry
That I hurt her so much

Suzanne takes with her
To a bank on the water
A thousand ships pass
And yet it will not get later
And you know she's crazy
Because that's why you're sitting next to her
And she gives you mints
Because she likes to give you something tangible
And just when you want to tell her
I can't give you love
The whole city comes to life
And you can hear seagulls screaming
You have always loved her
And you want to go with her
Together to the other side
And you have to trust her
Because she holds all your thoughts in her hand



And Jesus was a fisherman
Who trusted the water so much
That he just walked across the sea
Because he had learned to love
From the waves and the surf
In which no one can drown
He said "If you keep believing,
the heaviest stone cannot sink. "
But heaven just opened
When his body was broken
And how he suffered
Only that fisherman knows
on the cross ...
And you want to go with him
Together to the other side
And you have to trust him
Because he holds all your thoughts in his hand

Suzanne takes with her
To a bank on the water
You remember what she's looking at
As a reminder for later
And the sunlight is like honey
What children enjoy
And the lawn is littered
With what people do away with
The heroes lie in the gutter
With a smile on their lips
And the seagulls in the sky
Look like stray dots
When Suzanne looks at you smiling
And you want to go with her
Together to the other side
And you have to trust her
Because she holds all your thoughts in her hand <|endoftext|> 
I don't know what got you this far
When I see you at night in the park
The car lights shine on your body
Without eyes, without memory

I guess you never had love
Not even when that was so important to you
The words that belong to you are cheaper than I thought
In 1 second it started raining last night

Get out of that world
1 second, and speed through that world
Get out of that world
1 second, and take a good look around our paradise
And don't ask for directions, because everyone is lost

In search of happiness in Kronenburg Park
At home, a woman waits ignorantly for her husband
She never felt any sense of his dissatisfaction
And everything stays the same when he drives home



Get out of that world
1 second, and speed through that world
Get out of that world
1 second, and take a good look around our paradise
And don't ask for directions, because everyone is lost

Aaaah
And everything stays the same
When he drives home

Get out of that world

Get out of that world
1 second, and take a good look around our paradise
And don't ask for directions, because everyone is lost

Let me

You asked me for a chance, I gave it to you
but that turned out to be a big game, because I figured you out
you don't play with my life from today
you have your own friends for that

Chorus:
let me
I say one more time ... allow me
all your lies, all your words
don't count for me anymore
let me
I say again ... allow me
what seemed so beautiful is now over and over

oheho (chorus)
.... you don't have to explain anything to me anymore
oheho (chorus)
.... I've really had it with you



now you show your grief, but that's only for a moment
tears that I see now leave me cold
everything I owned I gave you
but I've trusted you for far too long

Ref:
Let me go,
I prefer to stand on my own two feet
Let me go,
And now spread my wings myself
I want to float on the clouds
Driven by the wind

Let me go,
So that I might still find happiness

When you say you really love me
Have always trusted me for years
If you want me to be happy
Well, then you set me free

It's not your fault if I ask you this
But know there is no other
Because I prefer to leave today
I've missed my life



Let me go,
I prefer to stand on my own two feet
Let me go,
And now spread my wings myself
I want to float on the clouds
Driven by the wind

Jannes - Let me go

I lie awake for nights because I fight with my feelings
 Because I know you'll be crying later, don't get what I'm talking about
 But I listen to my heart, know only one medicine
 So I choose myself now, even if it hurts you

 Let me go, I want to live again
 I gave everything I could do
 Let me go, I want to be free again
 If I ever had a dream, always be with you
 But I no longer have dreams, I want to be free again



 Don't think I'm enjoying myself now, even though I'm free again
 I empathize with your grief but no tears for me
 I had a wonderful time with you for years
 But the cake is finished, I feel liberated from everything

 Let me go, I want to live again
 I gave everything I could do
 Let me go, I want to be free again
 If I ever had a dream, always be with you
 But I no longer have dreams, I want to be free again

 Let me go, I want to live again
 I gave everything I could do
 Let me go, I want to be free again
 If I ever had a dream, always be with you
 But I no longer have dreams, I want to be free again <|endoftext|> 
aaahaahaa
leave me alone..
aaahaahaa
leave me alone..
aahaahaa

tried everything ..
I've often insisted on you
think love is true
so now play on a cart
you have another
it is over

leave me alone
I do not need you
you are redundant
because your heart is made of stone

leave me alone
everything is over now ..
you cheated on me
leave me alone..

ahaahaa
leave me alone..
ahaahaa



tell the truth
the end is now here
I don't want you no
you cheated me over and over

leave me alone
I do not need you
you are redundant
because your heart is made of stone

leave me alone
everything is over now
you cheated on me
leave me alone

leave me alone
I do not need you
you are redundant
because your heart is made of stone

leave me alone
everything is over now
you cheated on me
leave me alone..

leave me alone
I do not need you
you cheated on me
leave me alone.. <|endoftext|> 
Jannes - On fire

I travel all over the country and I sing almost everywhere
The girls are waiting in rows where I will come,
Yes they wanna take a picture with me
They give flowers and are loyal to me,
But still there is only one for me
But one that I really love.

--CHORUS--
I'm on fire
The fence is off the dam,
I saw you and it happened
I can't live like this anymore
I really can't live without you now!
Because of your sweet smile,
I was immediately upset
There is only one thing I want
That's you in my arms
Know that I am singing this song to you!



The party can begin now
Now turn on the music,
The tent goes crazy
And anyone who sings spontaneously,
I will thank the fans for this,
And the appauls is for them too,
But then that desire takes hold of me,
That I will soon be very close to you!

--CHORUS--
I'm on fire

I am dreaming of this summer
oheo oheo
it ended too soon.
oheo oheo
I still hear tropical sounds every night.
yes this summer has brought so much beauty

Let the sun shine
a nice long lie here on the beach.
Let the sun shine
with an ice cold beer in each hand.
no no cloud no no rain just the sun. yes i wish i could live forever.
1000 gorgeous women, my heart is racing.
yes it is crazy here, I will keep this up.

Let the sun shine
a nice long lie here on the beach.
Let the sun shine
with an ice cold beer in each hand.

I don't want to dream of you
I don't want your dreams.
I don't wanna think about you
because that hurts me a lot.
And I don't look at that picture
of the two of us there on the beach,
when we lay there together in beautiful Greece.

But I want you
I want you back
I want to go to Greece
I want the sun on my skin again
I want to go to Greece.
Because I feel at home with you
O my Greek girl.
I belong with you
and when I'm with you again
you become my wife.



How long should this take?
Until I can be with you again
All those lonely hours
They hurt me more and more
I don't wanna think about it
what you do without me
Maybe you have someone else
and you didn't like me anymore
But I want you, I want you back

I want to go to Greece
I want the sun on my skin again
I want to go to Greece.
Because I feel at home with you
O my Greek girl.
I belong with you and
when I'm with you again
you become my wife.

I don't shed tears for you
Because I know you always wanted to
You really don't hurt me
That's why no one ever sees a tear from me
I kept my drawer safe
That's all I've saved
I want you to remember only one thing now
I don't shed tears for you

I just have to forget about our years together
It seemed lucky, but it flew by again
If I had known beforehand
Then I knew this woman is not for me anyway
How you were or what you did as long as you never forget this
That I know one thing for sure now



I don't shed tears for you
Because I know you always wanted to
You really don't hurt me
That's why no one ever sees a tear from me
I kept my drawer safe
That's all I've saved
I want you to remember only one thing now
I don't shed tears for you

I don't shed tears for you

love is more than a game
you know that I love you
give me a chance and you know
that I only live for you

I need you all my life
but you leave me in uncertainty
even though I want to give you everything I can't give you my love
I need you every day but you keep telling me no
give me a chance and I'll make you happy
all your life

come take my hand and look at me
why don't you see me
you pretend you don't see anything
and that makes me very sad



I need you all my life
but you leave me in uncertainty
even though I want to give you everything I can't give you my love
I need you every day but you keep telling me no
give me a chance and I'll make you happy
all your life

I need you all my life but you leave me alone in uncertainty
even though I want to give you everything ... <|endoftext|> 
I've been waiting for weeks now
Here on a sign of life
Of that girl I dream about so much

“I know her name
I forgot the rest
Even her phone number

But it will take a while
Then I meet her again
And then I look at her for a moment

I already know what I'm saying
Maybe she will run away
But I'll never let her go

I want a little bit of you
Not much, but still something
Because I know today will be my day

I don't want a little bit much, but you know that
That's why I'm asking you this now

I want a little bit of you
Not much, but still something
Even if you only give me your name

I'm not saying you have to
But it still makes my day
I'm totally upset because of you

She is so special
A wonder of the world for me
She really is a whopper of a girl

If she would know
How I was sweating here
Because I really lost everything about her



I've been looking
Pants in shirts jackets
To a small piece of paper that said

Her name and address
and even her 06
I wish I found it.

I want a little bit of you
Not much, but still something
Because I know well with you today

Very little bit, not much, but oh well that little bit
That's why I'm asking you this now

I want a little bit of you
Not much, but still something
Even if you only give me your name

I'm not saying you have to
But it still makes my day
I am totally upset

I want a little bit of you
Not much, but still something
Because I know well with you today

Very little bit, not much, but oh well that little bit
That's why I'm asking you this now

I want a little bit of you
Not much, but still something
Even if you only give me your name

I'm not saying you have to
But it still makes my day
I am totally upset <|endoftext|> 
always then I think what is about me
together we had it together well
but that's over
you are no longer with me

I am alone
where do I have to go
without you I am lost
because for me there is only one

once you were with me again
my love that was you
why did you do this to me
why did you leave

I miss your eyes your mouth and your sweet smile
i miss your love your warmth close to me
I just want one thing
I want you .. yes that's you



I am alone
where do I have to go
without you I am lost
because for me there is only one

once you were close to me
my love that was you
why did you do this to me
why did you leave

I am alone,
where do I have to go,
without you i'm lost
because for me there is only one ..

without you I am lost
because for me there is only one .. <|endoftext|> 
Looking into my heart
I see what no one will ever see

I'll keep it to myself
And maybe protect myself

But anyone can get anything from me
My heart and soul, but a part close to me

Because I cry alone
No one in the world sees my tears

I share my smile with everyone
But I keep tears for the night

Yes for the night

So I cry alone
That brought wisdom with the years

I'll get over it myself
Although I am not made of stone

But I cry alone

Friends often say
You only share your smile with us

Give up your grief
That is part of friendship every day



Then I go quiet
And I say let me go now

A true friend has earned my joy

Because I cry alone
No one in the world sees my tears

I share my smile with everyone
But I keep tears for the night

Yes for the night

So I cry alone
That brought wisdom with the years

I'll get over it myself
Although I am not made of stone

But I cry alone

So I cry alone
That brought wisdom with the years

I'll get over it myself
Although I am not made of stone

But I cry alone <|endoftext|> 
You only live in this world once.
So I make something of it.
I live the way I want.
And I'll get what I can get.
I won't let myself be told anymore.
That is past tense.
I do what I want in all honesty.

It's about time for myself.
I had forgotten that for a moment.
It's time for you and me.
And everyone should know that.
there is only 1 here in my life,
that can still touch me.
The rest can watch it,
I go my own way.

Let me live like this.
Let me do my own thing.
Let me live like this.
Because that's how I can handle the whole world.

Sometimes I do things
which I should actually leave.
But you don't hear me complain
Because that's how I feel good.
I live my own life,
 whatever people think of it.
It is my own life.
Owh I do my own thing.

It's about time for myself.
I forgot for a moment.
It's time for you and me.
and everyone should know that.
There is only 1 in my life that can still touch me.
And the rest can watch it.
Because I go my own way.

Let me live like this.
Let me do my own thing.
Let me live like this.
Because that's how I can handle the whole world

it's time for myself
forgot it for a moment
it's time for you and me
everyone should know that.
There is 1 in my life,
that can still touch me.
The rest can watch it.
Because I go my own way.



Let me live like this.
Let me do my own thing.
Let me live like this.
Because that's how I can handle the whole world.

Take a look outside.
The street.
Look at the people with their own problems.
Like you, they are.
Because, just like you, they have to take so much
What I want to say you are never alone.
They just don't say I have a problem

Everyone knows so well what someone else does.
but they don't see themselves that is their greatest sorrow
Is true look around you.
People laugh at someone else

Yes tis such fun gloating.
As long as it doesn't affect me, everything turns around.
And then you feel stupid
But then you have learned what someone else should feel

Even if you don't have a penny.
Are empty.
Then know that the sun will also shine for you

Because rich or poor is the same
Everyone has to disappear here once



If you have problems, tell them your heart
if you don't, someone else will do it for you.

Ag everyone knows well what someone else does.
but they don't see themselves that is their greatest sorrow
Is true look around you.
People laugh at someone else

Yes tis such fun gloating.
As long as it doesn't affect me, everything turns around.

Leave me a minute, leave me alone
Let me get used to you not kissing me anymore
Just let me forget who you are
Let me pretend I never knew you
If you are the best thing that happened to me
Still, I can't stop dreaming of you
If you are the most beautiful in my life
Let me, let me

Let me think you're still with me
That the pain has disappeared
Maybe you still get used to it
It hits me deeper than I expected
Let me dream that you're with me tonight
Because you're the best thing that happened to me
I can't stop dreaming of you
Even though you are the most beautiful in all my life
Let me, let me

refr .:
    I've given you so much
    There's nothing left, so let me go
    Oh never, no never
    Would I do it again



It'll be much better if you stop calling me
Because I think you made the rules
Let me go, I'll leave you too
Even if everything I wanted will go up in smoke with you
And are you the best thing that happened to me?
Still, I can never stop dreaming of you
Even though you are the most beautiful in all my life
Let me, let me

refr.

I've lost you forever
Will I ever, ever hear from you again?
Never, never never
I would never do it like this again <|endoftext|> 
let me go so let me, before I feel guilty, and lose her for an evening hour, let me.
I can't stay with you
there is no more room in my heart, because I gave it to her.
no i can't cheat her, i can't lie to her
she could never forgive me for this.
only with her can I live happily,
what I get you can never give!
really i have to go now this was for a while.
later when you've forgotten me and you've got your own guy you'll understand why I'm leaving
tears you know me too short for that
I really think this is very bad, but you could have known this, that I can't cheat on her I can't lie
she could never forgive me for this
only with her can I live happily
what I get you can never give
no I have to go now
this was for a while.
oohh oohh oohh
only with her can I live happily
what I get you can never give
no I have to go now this was for a while
it is really true i can't cheat on her
I can't lie to her
she could never forgive me for this
only with her can I live happily!
what I get you cannot give
ohh i have to go now this was for a while
oohh oohh <|endoftext|> 
Turn around
I want to ask you, let me go
Look at me
I want to be alone. yes really free
I don't feel anything anymore
Not for you
It's better this way
No it has been fun
I'll move on, but without you

I don't want to anymore
It really doesn't hurt me now
Let me go, let me go
Forget what we've done
Forget me, ooh

No, not a kiss
Before I leave here
It's that good
I'm not staying here because I have to
It is over
Yes really over
I really don't feel like you anymore
No it has been fun
I will continue, but without a wife



I don't want to anymore
It really doesn't hurt me now
Let me go, let me go
Forget what we've done
Forget me, ooh

I know there is the door
Here you have the key
Leave everything alone, that's for you

I don't want to anymore
It really doesn't hurt me now
Let me go, let me go
Forget what we've done
Forget me, ooh <|endoftext|> 
refr .:
    Let the sun shine, yes then I can dream
    From the warm beach, the blue sky and a terrace
    Nice to drop by, catch a disco
    With luck, you won't be alone when you wake up

My blood starts to flow faster I know how that came about
They are the rays of the sun
I can smell the sea, see the beaches, I think of warm countries
I want to go there if I could



refr. (2x)

Bored I look outside, I count the drops on my windows
It's cold again like every year
You hang inside all day, making up an excuse
What should I do, I just sat there

refr. (4x) <|endoftext|> 
People, oh people, don't hurt each other
People still oh people still let it always be peace

When I watch television in the evening I almost only see hate
He was born in a stable people still be happy
He came for you and me too

People, oh people, don't hurt each other
People still oh people still let it always be peace

And I hardly see anyone on the street who is smiling anymore
Even when the sun is shining
People just walk through who knows what for
Live in peace with one another in this New Year



People, oh people, don't hurt each other
People still oh people still let it always be peace

People, oh people, don't hurt each other
People still oh people still let it always be peace <|endoftext|> 
When you grow up I will tell you
Why your mother is no longer with us now
I would have liked to tell you much earlier
Yes really I know you miss her so much

You must understand that I had already seen that
That things weren't going well between you and Mom
I am not a child anymore if you think so
When mother walked away I watched her for a long time

Come home again
You should know that we really love you
Come home now
Without you it is so cold and quiet in the house

Come home again
You should know that we really love you
Oh come on now come home
Without you it is so cold and quiet in the house



It's my fault she ran away
Don't say that now you did your best
I think it's bad that this had to be done like this now
Cry on my shoulder and smile at the rest

I looked outside from our class
Then I saw mama she was standing there on the corner
I wanted to scream for her to wait for me
But when the bell rang, she was long gone

Come home again
You should know that we really love you
Oh come on now come home
Without you it is so cold and quiet in the house <|endoftext|> 
His black hair. his brown face
His sideburns densely hairy
And always holding his guitar in his hand
Today is a dark day
Especially for him who is always smiling
La mama is no longer she died last night



La mama, that you're gone now makes me feel very sad
I'll play for you one more time
with all my heart even if you don't hear me
la mama i will always think of you
you were the example for your people and me
la mama that i am your son makes me happy

You were a real queen to us gypsies, a goddess
la mama, you will always survive
a consolation, you will never be chased away again
I now get your throne without being asked
although you didn't have much you never complained. <|endoftext|> 
It is quiet in the house, the evening has fallen
The lights in the street are on again
My little boy, he looks sad
I ask him: my Child, what's the matter
Then he gently puts his arm on my shoulder
And says he made a song
I had to promise him not to cry
Because this song may touch my heart

Come home mom
We are so alone
I'm sitting here with Dad
Where have you gone?
Is there another
Daddy is sweet
Get back together
Mommy please

I told him his mommy had left
Because it didn't go on like that for us
I asked him if he just wanted to sleep
And quickly put him to bed my darling
When I came back to the quiet room
Closed my eyes and thought of the past
There I heard my little sweet boy
He sang very softly there in his little room



Come home mom
We are so alone
I'm sitting here with Dad
Where have you gone?
Is there another
Daddy is sweet
Get back together
Mommy please

Come home mom
Daddy is sweet
Get back together
Mommy please

goodnight boy
goodnight daddy <|endoftext|> 
Little boy
You are in this world
So you will have to fight
Like me
I can know
Life is not easy
There is adversity at every moment

Little boy
There are many good people
But there are also bad ones
Unfortunately, it is true
You just have to think
That you will soon realize
That honestly takes the longest
Just believe me

refr .:
    This life is passing
    There is so little time so live because you are free
    But do it wisely and make people happy
    Then you will be really happy
    Because life is so short
    Many things change as you get older
    You are still playing with blocks, but that will not take long
    It's a shame, but you don't stay small



Little boy
You will notice at school
It's all about numbers and power
That's life
So learn what to learn
Because then you are the one who laughs last

Little boy
When you grow up later
Then your father may be gone
Then tell your own children
The wise lessons of your old gentleman

refr.

Little boy <|endoftext|> 
Look around the store are still open
See all those people buying something for their children
Because it's Christmas for me and everyone
But not for you because you left me

I know you sit there lonely, grieving
And no one can cheer you up for Christmas
Because what you miss, no, it is not for sale
Now you cry tears on your pillow

The snow is falling down just not for the two of us
Because you had to go to the other person
He played with you for a week then took another woman
Now you celebrate your Christmas so lonely and alone

I sent a Christmas card last week
Then I wrote to you it took long enough
I didn't get an answer, but I don't beg
That's why I'm singing this Christmas song to you



The snow is falling down just not for the two of us
Because you had to go to the other person
He played with you for a week then took another woman
Now you celebrate your Christmas so lonely and alone

The snow is falling down just not for the two of us
Because you had to go to the other person
He played with you for a week then took another woman
Now you celebrate your Christmas so lonely and alone
Now you celebrate your Christmas so lonely and alone <|endoftext|> 
Who can tell me what I've done
Because she has disappeared from me
There was a note with the words: 'Goodbye'
But she cannot mean that now
I thought things were going well between her and me
I thought it could never happen
Now I sit alone and stare straight ahead
How did I use this now

refr .:
    Come back, come back
    I gave my life to you
    Come back
    Come back, come back
    Why don't I have you with me now
    Come back



Why didn't you tell me this before
Then I could have talked to you
We hadn't argued or had words
You can't just start hating me
I thought things were going well between her and me
I thought it could never happen
Now I sit alone and stare straight ahead
How did I use this now

refr.

Come back, come back
I gave my life to you
Come back <|endoftext|> 
I can't live alone I would get lost without a wife
I have to live with someone but sometimes I just think why on earth with you
There are millions of beautiful girls meekly patient and faithful
I can choose another but would lose immediately I just can't do without you

You have changed over the years, I often see you late at noon
With those curlers in your hair even though you know I hate it
You grumble when I sit down to smoke, only think of your ashes on the carpet
You sigh how closely I have to cook again as if it were hungry winter

I can't live alone I would get lost without a wife
I have to live with someone but sometimes I just think why on earth with you
There are millions of beautiful girls meekly patient and faithful
I can choose another but would lose immediately I just can't do without you



And once I ran away I forged the door behind me
I roamed and drank until I was desperate and tired
There I stood shaky before your eyes thinking of course you become false
I really liked that then, but you fell sobbing around my neck

I can't live alone I would get lost without a wife
I have to live with someone but sometimes I just think why on earth with you
There are millions of beautiful girls meekly patient and faithful
I can choose another but would lose immediately I just can't do without you <|endoftext|> 
Christmas in Holland romantic atmosphere
And little white flakes fall down from the sky
Christmas in Holland a child's voice sounds
That voice can move us and we hear what she sings in silence

The tower bells also sing bim bam bim bam
They bring back memories in our hearts
Christmas in Holland a year flew by
And when the candles burn I see you again with me in the flames



I will give a spotless white world when Christmas comes again
It is as if the noise of that world around Christmas was suddenly distant
Christmas in Holland romantic atmosphere
And little white flakes fall down from the sky
Christmas in Holland a child's voice sounds
That voice can move us and we hear what she sings in silence

Christmas in Holland <|endoftext|> 
I have yet to buy a Christmas tree, candles and angel hair.
What is waiting for me at home, I need that, because that makes me happy.

We will then decorate the tree together, and my children who sing Silent Night. Yes, then I see my family enjoying themselves, that feeling gives me so much strength.

A Christmas wreath is cut, with a hot cup of chocolate, yes this is how my Christmas party must be every year, then I think who is imitating this, who is imitating this.

Christmas for us, that warmth and tenderness.
These are the best days of the year, that's really true.
For a moment I do not care about the work, no then I am there for them, I want to share it with them.

Yes these are my days.
This is the most beautiful party of the whole year.



Grandpa and grandma come in the morning.
And then talk about their childhood.
Ah, they can tell so wonderfully how Christmas was celebrated then.

A Christmas wreath is cut, with a hot cup of chocolate, yes this is how my Christmas party must be every year, then I think who is imitating this, who is imitating this.

When the tower bells ring at Christmas
It is quiet with us in the Jordaan
And then I keep seeing in my mind
Still have my very first Christmas tree
I will never forget that time
Where in the world I will go
I will never know a better Christmas
Then with us in the Jordaan

I can still see myself walking with mother at the very last moment
To buy a Christmas tree because that saved another cent
The best thing about celebrating Christmas was decorating that tree
And then we sang very softly with my mother silent night



When the tower bells ring at Christmas
It is quiet with us in the Jordaan
And then I keep seeing in my mind
Still have my very first Christmas tree
I will never forget that time

Then with us in the Jordaan <|endoftext|> 
You told me you'll always stay with me
But that promise passed very quickly
A picture on the wall
We go hand in hand together
I know now you don't love me anymore

I close my eyes and I see you
You were the most beautiful woman to me
Why did you leave?
Believe me when I say
that I still love you very much!

Still, I will wait
days and nights
and keep hoping
because I can't forget you
when I hear your voice
am I lost
what I feel about
that's life for me



You told me you'll always stay with me
But that promise passed very quickly
A picture on the wall
We go hand in hand together
I know now you don't love me anymore

I close my eyes and I see you
You were the most beautiful woman to me
Why did you leave?
Believe me when I say
that I still love you very much!

Why did you leave?
Believe me when I say
that I still love you very much! <|endoftext|> 
The chance you gave me
I have lost my treasure
I feel so stupid now
but that is too late now
My suitcase is already outside
where can I go now?
You're right,
I was no good, I was mean
You're right my baby
yes really right my dear

I didn't think about it when she lay here next to me
I thought you never really knew
But you have so many friends
I didn't think about that,
there are 2 who want my place
But you're right my baby
yes really right my dear



I want to thank you
you were good to me
But that's over now
Don't be mad at me now
You're free now
Yes all the blame is on me

I'll never see you again
but you are in my heart
How could I ever be so stupid
We had such a good time
Can I still ask you
if I can do something for you
I know you'd rather see me go
and that you really don't like me anymore
I did this myself

You're right my baby
yes really right my dear
Still you stay in my heart
Yes really right my dear <|endoftext|> 
Where are you going, who will know?
Where you go I will not be
But where you are, I will meet you there again
I hear your voice, you call me very softly.

I'm counting all my empty days now
And wonder why you?
Despite a lot of pain I never heard you complain
You saved your last smile for me.



(Chorus)
In every love song
I meet you
In every ray of sunshine
I see you standing there
That you gave your love
That was a blessing
Although that time has gone way too fast
What can comfort me now
Is the past
I proudly bear the pain
Of my sorrow
For what was of value
Have you fought
But this fight ... you didn't win that.

Only now do I realize
That it was much more
You gave me so much hope and confidence
Not exist for nothing
I will continue
Because you were an example in my life.

(Netjuh) <|endoftext|> 
What I want, you want too
The two of us, hand in hand
In Acapulco, in the Bahamas
Like two lovers, there on the beach

What I want, you want too
The two of us, far from here
A very nice life and not for a while
Very free and happy, a rich existence

[Chorus:]
But hey, as long as I'm with you
Life is good already
As long as I'm with you
I have everything I need
I would like to be with you always

What I want, you want too
Princes life is really something for me
Lots of servants, always enjoying
Really without worries with you there



[Chorus:]
But hey, as long as I'm with you
Life is good already
As long as I'm with you
I have everything I need

I would like to be with you always

In Acapulco, in the Bahamas
Like two lovers, there on the beach

[Chorus:]
But hey, as long as I'm with you
Life is good already
As long as I'm with you
I have everything I need

I would like to be with you always
I would like to be with you always
Always be with you <|endoftext|> 
Tango d'amour

When the sun disappears the night appears
Then the desire emerges
No we don't say anything, not a single word
A kiss at the last chord
I do not have to expect more, you have not promised me more
Therefore dance with me only with me
Sadness is tolerated again

Tango d ámour
Is the dance of love
Tango d'Amour
Brings me to you again and again
Hold me tight if it takes a while
Floating through the night in those arms of yours

Tango d'amour is the dance of love
Full of passion and fire
In this last hour
That tango d'amour

This melody, melancholy
Keeps coming back to my dream
Then I relive that time with you
Give away how much I love you
"I want to relive this moment
When I hear those sounds again
it brought good luck
but hurt
because I lost my love



Tango d "˜amour
Is the dance of love
Tango d'amour
Brings me to you again and again
Hold me tight
Seven through the night
In those arms of yours
Tango d'amour
Is the dance of love
Full of passion and fire
In this last hour

Hold me tight if it takes a while
Floating through the night
In those arms of yours

Tango d'amour is the dance of love
Full of passion and fire
In this last hour
That tango d'amour

Tango d'amour is the dance of love
Full of passion and fire
In this last hour
That tango d'amour <|endoftext|> 
In the evening you leave me alone
I have no one around me
smoke my last cigarette
then I go to bed alone
my thoughts hurt so
where would you be tonight
It's already 2 o'clock in the morning
and I waiting for you

refr.
        You think you can do anything with me
        I'm in a cage here and you are free
        how stupid I am to wait
        yes I always wait all night



        You think you can do anything with me
        but that will be over for good after tonight
        a lie has won over loyalty
        what kind of woman are you

I look aimlessly at the wallpaper
and wait for your footstep in the hallway
the clock accompany my silent sorrow
you don't understand what I feel
sometimes I did something wrong
we can go on like this
It's like you're not enriching me
I am so insecure

I hear I come from rommedomdom
I beat my drum of rubbish
A shepherd away from rommedomdom
Sent me here from rommedomdom rommedomdom rommedomdom
I want to see the baby of foolishness
Is that possible?

King's baby of rommedomdom
May I be your foolish boyfriend
I'm poor, I just come from rommedomdom
I also don't bring a gift from Rommedomdom Rommedomdom Rommedomdom
I only have my drum of gibberish for that

But I'll hit with shitty domination
I beat my drum of foolishness in the stable
I play the king's child of rommedomdom
That he loves rommedomdom rommedomdom rommedomdom



And he laughs about it with foolishness
Me and my drum <|endoftext|> 
(Frans Bauer and Marianne Weber)

If you knew how I long for you
Then you came here to me very soon
I too have that feeling all day long
My heart cries inside you are my smile
I keep seeing you in my mind
Those moments keep getting more
Because I know you are mine
Then that dream is over for good



refr .:
    And my heart keeps calling your name
    One day you will stand before me
    Your voice keeps ringing in my head
    As if you're already close to me here

Without you it is so cold and chilly
Also in the house it is so sad and quiet
Every hour I think, if only you were here
All my dreams come true at once
What I want to say to you is only brief
Because everything will change someday
Because I know you come to me
Then that dream is over for good

(Frans Bauer and Marianne Weber)

Look at me for a moment
Do you have time for me
I know in my life
No one like you

refr .:
    Sha lala, stay with me
    Sha lala, forever

I can trust you
You are always a friend
I can rely on you
When I laugh or whine



refr.

Do I ever have questions
I am never alone
And in the event of setbacks
You help me through it

refr.

Wherever I may go
I will never forget you
And I feel lonely
I'm holding on to you

refr. (3x) <|endoftext|> 
(Frans Bauer and Marianne Weber)

Sometimes I think back
Those moments
When you were still here
We were young
And inexperienced
But happy that I was



refr .:
    Read our story
    Often back in my diary
    Seems so long ago
    The memory of the two of us
    That beautiful time
    I will never forget
    But that's over
    But I keep dreaming, that's life

My life is
From that day on
Completely changed
Everyone has their own way
A whole new life
It became so different

refr. <|endoftext|> 
I see lights in your eyes

We met each other much too young
Our love was allowed to exist for a while
Because we knew nothing about life then
It is not surprising that it went wrong
Our ways then had to part
But life has taught us a lot
"It was a difficult road for both of us
The tide has finally turned

I see lights in your eyes
Hear the love in your voice
And I feel so happy
Roof you have never forgotten
Now I'm back in your arms
And that feels so familiar
We will never break up again
Yes, we grow old together



The past let us rest
All those sweethearts don't count anymore
How many others I kissed later
I was secretly thinking about you every time
In the time we've lost
Well we will catch up with that
We now use every second
And now life has meaning again

I see lights in your eyes
Hear the love in your voice
And I feel so happy
Roof you have never forgotten
Now I'm back in your arms
And that feels so familiar
We will never break up again
Yes, we grow old together

I see lights in your eyes
Hear the love in your voice
And I feel so happy
Roof you have never forgotten
Now I'm back in your arms
And that feels so familiar
We will never break up again
Yes, we grow old together <|endoftext|> 
Look into my eyes
Because I see so much sadness

[refr.]
Look into my eyes
Because I see so much sadness
Comfort yourself with me
Because all those tears don't help
I'll be there for you
Every hour of the day
I'd rather see you with a smile

Come to me now, I'm here for you
Now tell me what's wrong
But before you talk, dry those tears quickly
And then say, what's wrong
You may be worried too much
Or do you have a heartbreak
You don't hide anything from me
You know I see everything



[refr.]

Let the sun shine again
Because you have earned that too
Don't be ashamed of me
I'm your friend after all

[refr.]

I'd rather see you with a smile <|endoftext|> 
(Frans Bauer and Marianne Weber)

A picture, because of your little picture
Did you already take us with you in mind?
A smile, your sweet smile
Asked us to come to you
In land far over the sea

Days, fourteen days
We could after all these years
Finally be with you
Time passes
We now say goodbye, even if it hurts us

refr .:
    Manuel goodbye, we have to get rid of you
    You are not alone with your brothers and sisters
    Your happiness was our dearest wish
    Manuel goodbye, our love knows no limit



Boy, sweet boy
In our hearts we are together forever
Tomorrow, think about tomorrow
Maybe someday we'll make it
All your childhood dreams come true

Later, who knows later
We can do it for few days
To be together again
Just think about that
We now say goodbye
Even though it hurts us

refr.

Manuel goodbye, our love knows no limit <|endoftext|> 
Child of mine

My first child was so happy.
Because you were really part of me
Your first smile your hand that was looking for me
I was so proud to be your mother
I taught you to talk and walk
But what you are doing now is wrong
You laugh at my tears and make me sad
Because I didn't teach you how you live now.



refr.
You child of mine yes you will remain.
Whatever another may think
And however you continue to hurt me
I will always be there for you
Because you still remain a child of mine
I will always love you
because you are a child of mine.

You made a mess of your existence
wonder where it went wrong.
Wrong friends on the wrong path,
have you forgotten what I taught you before darling <|endoftext|> 
When I saw you I knew immediately that you would be mine forever
That one night was no doubt convincing
Next day (next day)
Was I in love (was I in love)
Never felt that for anyone
A sultry night (a sultry night)
But inside I was cheering

I'll never let you go
I've seen or done everything
And if I still get the chance to be with you
I grab him
I grab him
I never want to lose you
Prepared me for this all my life
No, I really won't let you go
And I prefer to be with you all the time, all the time

Because of what you are and what you do
For what you say and for everything you care
Because you're alive, I'm upside down with you
What I dream of (what I dream of)
That one day (that one day)
We hand in hand together before the altar
And we each other (and we each other)
Promise Eternal Loyalty
Oh yeah!

I'll never let you go
I've seen or done everything
And if I still get the chance to be with you
I grab him
I grab him
I never want to lose you
Prepared me for this all my life
No, I really won't let you go
And I prefer to be with you all the time, all the time



It will happen to you, meet the love of your life
And then never see it again
No I know better, and I don't settle for maybe
Oh yeah!

I'll never let you go
I've seen or done everything
And if I still get the chance to be with you
I grab him
I grab him
I never want to lose you
Prepared me for this all my life
No, I really won't let you go
And I prefer to be with you all the time, all the time

No, I really won't let you go
And I prefer to be with you all the time, all the time <|endoftext|> 
Sorry, always sorry
that's what you say
How can we continue like this
it is no longer possible
Always you always know
I will give in to your tears
But this time it is too late
it is no longer possible
CHORUS;
You know I still love you
after all this time, after all these years
The thoughts that you would leave me
I can't bear it
You know I still love you
Is it over or are we going to fight?
I can't just let you go
I love you anyway

Nights so many nights
I lie here alone
And where you are and what you do
I do not know anymore
Dreams are there still dreams
for you and me, or is it over
Then tell me what you feel
I do not know anymore
CHORUS;
You know I still love you
After all this time, after all these years
The thoughts that you would leave me
I can't bear it
You know I still love you
Is it over or are we going to fight?
I can't just let you go
I love you anyway
I can't just let you go
I love you anyway. <|endoftext|> 
I'll never let you go

I'll never let you go
I never want another
We belong together
Like the stars and the moon
I'll never let you go
You are my whole life
I want to give you everything
My heart always keeps beating for you

"I love you so very much
That is why I always remain faithful to you
You are the only baby
Oh if I didn't have you

I'll never let you go
I never want another
We belong together
Like the stars and the moon
I'll never let you go
You are my whole life
I want to give you everything
My heart always keeps beating for you



I'll do anything for you
Even if it's just for a kiss
Feel so good with you
That's why I want to be with you

I'll never let you go
I never want another
We belong together
Like the stars and the moon
I'll never let you go
You are my whole life
I want to give you everything
My heart always keeps beating for you <|endoftext|> 
(Frans Bauer and Marianne Weber)

Look in my eyes
And tell me what you see
Look in my eyes
You see tears of sorrow



You are my life
You are my smile
If only I could dream
Give me the strength
Don't let me float now
That's why I ask you
Come back and look into my eyes

Look in my eyes
You understand me, not now
Look in my eyes
Do you grieve like me

You were my life
You were my smile
I can no longer dream
I miss the power now
I get on with my life
But look me in the eye <|endoftext|>

    Only you
    Gives my day its color
    Only you
    Gives every flower its fragrance
    I saw you
    We were young and free
    And you were so close
    I saw your smile and knew
    Love is coming
    Sometimes so unexpected
    All that sound instantly
    Dumb
    Only you
    Lives in my heart and I
    Be every moment
    With your thoughts = E9 = E9n



I was so confused by you in the beginning
You bring the warmth very deep into my heart
Without a word you say: I am yours
Since I met you

refr.

Love is coming
Sometimes so unexpected
All that sound instantly
Dumb
Only you
Lives in my heart and I
Be every moment
With your thoughts one <|endoftext|> 
I would love to say something to you
Even though words don't say much
It is not easy to explain
Although I know you want to hear this
What would I do without you
You who gave to me all your life
I don't have to make up words for you
Because you brought love into my life

[refr:]
This will be a day in a thousand dreams for us
You and I got together
Together we are on the road to happiness
This will be a day in a thousand dreams for us
I still ended up well
But I know there is no turning back



I feel the heat flowing through my body
You set my whole heart on fire
I dream of those moments to come
Those hours together made me a man
You give me more love than the other
Uncertainty now fades from my heart
I hope this never changes
Because every day is always a fresh start

The neon light colors the street,
the rain that talks to stones.

Where are you? (Where are you?)

The city becomes quiet
The night chills
While I'm sitting here in my chair

Where are you? (Where are you?)

The tower clock points at half past three
I don't know if I see you again

Where are you?

I can see all that through my window
Thoughtlessly says your name

Where are you?

The bleak wind chases a newspaper
There is still a light on the other side

Where are you?

And god how small I feel
Now that you don't want to be there anymore

Where are you?

I think with every footstep
I want to hear you have come back

The tower clock points at half past three
I'm waiting for you here

Where are you?

I love you!
I love you!
I love you all my life!
I love you!
Don't leave me alone here any longer.

The little one still asks for you
then she says "where is mama now"?

Where are you? (Where are you?)



I feel you are lonely now
You have known luck with me

Where are you? (Where are you?)

I walk aimlessly through our house here
Come home very soon now

Where are you? (Where are you?)

I am your husband you are my wife
I long for you so much

Where are you?

The bleak wind chases a newspaper
There is still a light on the other side

Where are you?

And god how small I feel
Now that you don't want to be with me anymore

Where are you?

I want to hear you have come back

I love you all my life!
I love you!
Don't leave me alone here any longer.
Don't leave me alone here any longer.

It remains a small miracle that I am with you
such a beautiful woman of my dreams
I wanted to live as a single
but nothing came of it
because I ran into you at a very young age
I was not that sold
you made me the happiest man
still enjoy it every day

I'm so crazy about you
when I look into your eyes
then I seem to float
then I feel so rich
I'm so crazy about you
I can enjoy that
I'll never let that go
that is mainly because of you

and now with the children, although it is sometimes difficult
it remains a gift in your life
I would prefer to go all day long
give all my attention at home
even though I am on the road for work
you are always on my mind
I enjoy my dear wife so much
you are my best present

lately you've been acting so strange to me
it seems like you're already saying goodbye to me
because every now and then you are so quiet with me
but I don't know how you want it to continue

how much am I supposed to love you
that you will stay with me forever
how much should I love you?
that you always stand behind me
how much am I supposed to love you?
that you'll be my girl forever
how much should I love you?
that you will never leave me



I'm not comfortable with it, but believe me now
honey, you're the one I love a lot
so free tonight with me, as I know you
and prove to me that I am your true one

how much am I supposed to love you
that you will stay with me forever
how much should I love you?
that you always stand behind me
how much am I supposed to love you?

Frans Duijts - I am happy with you

When we go out together and are at the bar
then I feel so rich
What a beauty you are
I don't want to lose you for gold
when I look at you like that
and when the two of us dance
you are dancing
I'm going crazy again
crazy about you, about my wife
then it's all hands on deck.

I am happy with you
you are my ideal
the most beautiful woman here of all
I am happy with you
I never want to lose you
because I have the sweetest girl with you

and when we get back home
then I can feel exactly how it continues
yes one thing i'm sure is this heartthrob
nothing to guess
I want to confess to you:
I'm going to spoil you, this will remain separate
kiss you softly because tonight
I love you with all my heart



I am happy with you
you are my ideal
the most beautiful woman here of all
I am happy with you
I never want to lose you

it's crazy that it goes like this and such a beautiful thing exists
in love from early morning until late at night

I am happy with you

What is happiness
If you have money but don't know any friends and you are alone, that is lucky
What is happiness
If you cannot share anything with another, the wealth, then that is luck
Well this is luck
If there is someone somewhere for you when you really need him
That feeling that you are really never alone, that only a true friend brings
Laugh with you, cry with you, fight for you and pray for you

Ref:
The best thing in your life is your friends
You share a smile and every tear with them
And everything they give cannot be found
It happens to you, it embraces them, and you never let them go
You don't have to explain anything to them in words
Because they look into your eyes, see every word there
The best thing in your life is your friends
There are not many of them, but they do exist

I'm waiting here, order one more
and after 10 minutes, the fourth for me
the clock in my enemy, it goes way too fast
I think of you every beat

the doors open, my hope is gone
you walk in with a guy by your side
can he now tonight, with you on the part
I nod to the bartender, pour over again

Yesterday I was your best friend
but today I didn't deserve you
what happened to you
you are a totally different woman
Yesterday everything was perfect
but today you're kidding me
I may have done something wrong
you just let me stand

you should be ashamed
but you have fun
the night now coincides
with a tear in my beer
my coat on my shoulder
because I have to get out
don't want to love you
t is over and out

Our weekend hotel was discreet,
hidden in dunes by the sea
Time flew too quickly
we lived as god in France
Our room with half board,
on the beach with a beautiful balcony
We got breakfast there bed,
and in the evening there was bal musette
Because the patron
yes the patron

Ref:
He played the accordion,
very just for the two of us
He played the accordion,
and we just turned along

The music and the wine,
a great feast
and we just turned along

Our weekend hotel at the time,
was not expensive, we were not rich
But I didn't want luxury
if only I slept very close to you
We dreamed on the quiet beach
a seagull takes the bread from your hand
Life gave us two as much
we built many castles in the air
In the salon where everything started

Our little hotel is over
it is so lonely now
As if it is still vibrating around you
because I still love you
I came there on my own again
the homesickness that drove me there
And the boss remained very discreet
did not ask about you, because he understood

Why did you go so early?
And was I sweet enough for you
Can you see how I burn a candle for you
And in my heart I still long for you

So much what I still have to tell you
Everything about you felt so good
And can you see how I burn a candle for you
And in my heart I still long for you

Give me something to let me know you see me
Give me something to let me know you're still with me
Give me a sign in the dark
Let the stars stand differently
No I'm not asking for a miracle, but give me something
Give me something



Whatever I do or say, it's too late
So give me your strength as if you were standing in front of me
Can you see how I burn a candle for you
And in my heart I still long for you

Give me something to let me know you're still with me

Sometimes I feel lonely and alone
I just walk somewhere
then I dream of love

Sometimes I feel tears burn
I can't stand anywhere for hours
then I dream of love
I want to be very close to you
I forget the pain for a moment
feel the beauty that then arises
how I wake up crying at night
then I dream of love
then I dream of love

because I put my arms around you
then I'll never leave you alone again
i feel the warmth so close
this night for you and me
I put my arms around you
then I'll never leave you alone
i feel the warmth so close
this night for you and me



Sometimes I am desperate with regret
I lost everything for a while
then I dream of love

Sometimes I forget my grief for a moment
the silence you left behind
then I dream of love
I want to be very close to you
I forget the pain for a moment
I feel the beauty that then arises
how I wake up crying at night

Bartender, give me one last drink
At least then I'm not alone for a while.
I say "You, I don't have to go home no thanks
I'm in divorce and I'm really through it.
Tomorrow I will be in court, he will give a ruling on custody.
I will always keep fighting for that little one, because he is part of me!

(Chorus)
If I am no longer allowed to see my child,
It makes no sense for me to continue living
That hurts too much.
He is my only happiness, please don't destroy that!
Promise you, I'll be a father to him.


His mother says, "You can't take care of him, you're never home, you don't even have a job."
But I tell you, that boy feels safe here, will be right behind him all my life.
She never cared about me, and our child was an accident.
She always rubbed that on me and she broke everything!

(Chorus)
If I am no longer allowed to see my child,
It makes no sense for me to continue living
That hurts too much.
He is my only happiness, please don't destroy that!
Go and promise you, I will be a father to him.




Because my boy, my ???, there is one of my existence
Judge give me that confidence!
I swear, despite everything, I can handle it!

(Chorus)
If I am no longer allowed to see my child,
It makes no sense for me to continue living
That hurts too much.
He is my only happiness, please don't destroy that!

No movie on TV, no sense in the cafe
And I shiver from the cold
The radio keeps playing, but everything I hear
Sounds gray and gray for a moment.

I turn around and around and around here
Like a lion in a cage
Prey to despair.

I get lost in the chilly night
Still, I keep watch
But you're not coming to me anyway
It makes no sense for me to wait for you anymore
I'll be alone tonight
I'm slowly getting tired of my life.

What did you expect from me
What would you have thought
Or what do you want me to do
Do you still want me to wait?
I'll see you tonight
Will you come back to me?

I turn around and around and around here
Like a lion in a cage
Prey to despair.

I'm bored to death here
my head is full of scrap
And I feel terribly down
You know where I live
I have a phone, but I still don't hear from you.

I've believed in it for a long time,
but the fairy tale did not come true
I did everything for you
you have consumed it yourself
What should I not take
nobody can handle that, right?
For me it is certain
yes, you can go from me

Ref:
Because I've had enough, I'm more than fed up with it
I'll never call you my baby again

I much rather have this pain
Then to be with you one more night

It promised so much
I was so crazy about you
But I don't want to fight
with the none that I love
No I'm not gonna cry
although sometimes a tear threatens
I'm not going to save anything anymore
no it's better to go

Lived, sometimes caught that paid an artist
Fame and applause, that's what he chooses
But it runs through my blood
It moves and embraces me
The times when I can't be with you
Hit my soul and often hurt me
Because you are for me
My hope and trust
I stand for the people I love so much
But every word I sing makes me think of you again and again

Go to sleep soundly, just turn off the light
I'll be entertaining here until it closes here
Don't stay up, dear, you know how it goes
One more sip, one more song
And I'm sure I'm late as always

Despite the allure and shine of the night
I know you are alone at home waiting for me
And every moment lies alone dreaming
That tonight is yours, you don't give way
No must, no people, no one around us
And that our moment will also remain ours
I am again in front of the people I love so much
But every word I sing makes me think of you again and again



So, go to sleep, just turn off the lights
I'll be entertaining here until it closes here
Don't stay up, dear, you know how it goes
One more sip, one more song
And as always I am stuck again
So often away, always on the road
I wish I always had you with me
But the planks are waiting
The lamps are on
Forgive me dear, but unfortunately I have to go again

Go to sleep soundly, just turn off the light
I'll be entertaining here until it closes here

Go to sleep soundly, just turn off the light
I'll be entertaining here until it closes here
Don't stay up, dear, you know how it goes

Must be late again!

As always, probably late again

Like little boys from the street
We learned mischief
Stealing apples from the groetenboer
A ball flew through the window
And the cop is coming
Danger was always lurking

And mother was once again lost
And Dad was in the pub
Then we would wander the streets all day long
We have laughed a lot
We had a blast
And to bed way too late every night

Just when you thought you'd seen everything
And you might have felt like a whole guy
Then something happens again
What you hadn't thought of
That there was another side to it
Just like you thought, I've done a good job
Then the whole thing gets together again
With a smile and with a tear
Will you go through life
But it's worth the effort



A little boy, just like a man
He thinks he can do everything
No nothing, was too crazy for me
I've tried everything
Life has learned a lot
But time passes too quickly

When I saw Abraham
Then I'll have fun for ten
Yes, then we will go wild
I like a Baco
And sometimes eat too fat
And to bed way too late every night

But honey, it feels so good
I am still touched by you

My great love is you
No one comes between you and me

Because where am I supposed to go?
You know I live for you
It already hurts inside

My heart is addicted to your love forever
I never want to lose that feeling

Enjoy along the beach
Winter has been long enough now
So put your warm sweater aside
Because the cold is over again
Spring in the country, we celebrate

refr .:
    The summer sun gives new meaning to life
    Children big and small play in the square
    Yes the sun revives our love
    Radiant faces, you feel good
    I can't stand rain
    Dark days are now gone forever
    The people are happy on the street
    And ask how you are doing
    The summer sun makes life worth living



At the campsite or by the sea
I enjoy with you
Or enjoy the sun on the balcony
Where you are it doesn't matter
Just get out there
Together with the warm summer sun

Yes, the world took on color
When you said to me: I like you
And the sun shone a little more
That first time with you
All birds kept whistling that melody
And I sing it every time I see you

Is it your eyes, is it your voice
Is it the words you say when I get back to you?
Is it your eyes, is it your smile
Are those things I can't miss you for a day

Every day is a miracle day
I can't be another day without you
Ever since I've known you, it's like I'm floating
And much more live as before
No, there is no second like you for me
so I want to be with you all my life



Is it your eyes, is it your voice
Is it the words you say when I get back to you?
Is it your eyes, is it your smile
Are those things I can't miss you for a day

Wherever I go I still hear that melody
And I sing it every time I see you

Is it your eyes, is it your voice
Is it the words you say when I get back to you?
Is it your eyes, is it your smile
Are those things I can't miss you?

Frans Duijts
It doesn't have to be without you

Every morning the coffee is too weak
my dirty laundry has been on the stairs for days
I keep up, but I really can't live without you
the drink that suddenly became my support and anchor
and I admit, I showed little backbone
my world black, in order to guess what should I do
the curtains remained closed because here I could hide nicely
no, no future in sight, if only I could trade with someone

it doesn't have to be without you
come back where are you staying
everything will be as it once was
I only realize how much I love you
we went right through everything
afraid of no one, we were one
I feel that old happiness with you

our love are stories you know
with ups and downs, and preferably a happy ending

I long for you so much, say every second

it doesn't have to be without you
come back where are you staying

I only realize how much I love you

afraid of no one, we were one
I feel that old happiness with you
we cannot go wrong together
you remain the woman for me
no it doesn't have to be without you <|endoftext|> 
Even if you sometimes feel sad, but no one sees that in you
You feel a bit sad and alone without a friend around you
You fight for that little bit of luck, even if the other person broke it
Enjoy every moment even when you are lonely

refr .:
    When you have lost everything in your life
    Your best friends suddenly don't see you anymore
    While you have given everything to the other
    But it was she who went to another
    When you have lost everything in your life
    Then think, there is still so much beauty in our existence



Don't be ashamed of a tear
You have to let go of your feelings
But love a smile most
Only then will you live every day
Even if it is a bit cold around you, you will get over it
Enjoy what life offers you
Although it has a lot of sorrow

refr. <|endoftext|> 
It's winter, yes, a world, white and cold
And the Christmas tree, it is so familiar here
And the snow is falling, I've never been so cold
Can't be heated, it's winter in my heart
I miss you so, I miss you so

          It's winter in my heart, I love you
          Why did you leave me here in the cold
          Without you here close to me
          It will never be Christmas again
          It's winter in my heart, I miss you so much
          And my very, very best Christmas present
          Is a Christmas close to you
          Because I love you so much



I hear the bells, all those voices in the street
I see people walking slowly past my window
And the cars are taking it easy tonight
But I wish I could let myself go
I miss you so, I miss you so

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Every day passes
I think about you, but you don't think about me
I feel bad because you are with the other
You know, we belong to mekander
And when the bells ring again in the night
Do I see your face again (?)

refr .:
    Why am I so alone at Christmas
    Why is it getting quieter around me
    Tell me why don't you let yourself be heard again
    Tell me why am I so alone at Christmas



Every year, at this time
I'm writing you a letter I'm sorry
Then I hope you will write to me again
But I know, you'll stick with him anyway
Now I sit here so all alone thinking of you
Only to you, because I don't want another wife

refr. (2x) <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes I still dream of all my childhood years
that I spent in the Jordan
that people in the street were your friends
they were there for you really day and night
On Saturday with Dad
watching monkeys
or stealing apples from that red jan
enjoy that old western tower
the pearl of our beautiful Amsterdam

Back to Mokum together
where our cradle stood
where we were born in that old faithful Jordan
We had a good time there
It has a very beautiful place in our hearts

Back to Mokum together
Where our cradle stood
in our own beautiful Jordaan

Red Nelis sang a lot
Aunt Leen and Johnny Jordaan's hit
And once a year the fair on the tree moat
How fast that time has passed

Back to Mokum together
where our cradle stood
Where we were born
in that old faithful Jordan
We had a good time there
It has a very beautiful place in our hearts
Together back to Mokum where our cradle stood
in our own beautiful Jordaan 2x <|endoftext|> 
refr .:
    Many more years of prosperity and happiness
    Go through life with a smile for many years to come
    Many more years to stay with me
    Many more years without grief and pain

Already a year older, but you
Still always stays young at heart
You give so much warmth, and I still love you
I'm so glad I can live with you
And that's why I say to you on this day



refr.

"We have had many wonderful years together
 And I want to thank you for that
 Even when things went against the grain, your love helped me through it
 You made all my dreams come true
 And I hope it can stay that way for a long time "

When spring comes I'll send you
tulips from Amsterdam.
When spring comes I pick for you.
tulips from Amsterdam.
When I come again I'll bring you
tulips from Amsterdam.

A thousand yellow, a thousand red,
I wish you the most beautiful,
what my mouth can't say
say tulips from amsterdam.

On the Amsterdam canals,
I pledged all my heart forever
Amsterdam, in my mind,
as the most beautiful city in our country

All those Amsterdam people,
All those lights in the square late at night,
No one could wish for better
than being an Amsterdammer <|endoftext|> 
1st verse:
I am happy, I shout it from the rooftops
Because everyone should know that I love you]
I'll be there when I'm needed
Because you're the sweetest I know

True love, mi amore
Chorus: amore, mi amore
You don't hesitate for a second
And everyone who can hear it

You are the life to me ... amore



2nd verse:
It was a hot holiday in Rome
My heart stopped for a moment when I saw your eyes
You and I, in that moment
Then it clicked between us that day

Chorus (2x) <|endoftext|> 
Are you in trouble sometimes?
You don't see your friends anymore
Do people make it worse
You accept it
You have to fight for it yourself
Someone else does not understand
They always have an opinion
But those words don't help you

refr .:
    Let them talk whatever they want
    Because people chat anyway
    Let them think what they think
    Because they fantasize anyway
    Let them look at their own
    There is always something
    What I hear are real lies
    And I am more than tired of that



Do you want to admit your mistakes
Repent and be very sorry
What is someone else to say
Who blames whom
Everyone knows better
You don't even know what's going on
One thing is sometimes forgotten
That love and suffering are shared

refr. (2x)

What I hear are real lies
And I am more than tired of that <|endoftext|> 
A shiny career, luck and happiness.
A wife and dear children, my dream could no longer be broken.
I have never had so many friends, wish them the best of luck.
But sometimes then life is even sharper than a knife.

Fight, fight together for happiness.
All my beautiful dreams seemed broken.
Yet you were there for me day and night.
After blood, sweat and tears, I am now happy again.

Fight, fight together for happiness.
All my beautiful dreams seemed broken.
But what I have learned is never wrong.
To fight, to fight for happiness.

Get on with my life, they won't break me.
And when you see me crying, it's tears of happiness.
You really do not hear me complain, although sometimes it is not easy.
Thank God I can still sing, come sing with me.



Fight, fight together for happiness.
All my beautiful dreams seemed broken.
Yet you were there for me day and night.
After blood, sweat and tears, I am now happy again.

Fight, fight together for happiness.
All my beautiful dreams seemed broken.
But what I have learned is never wrong.
To fight, to fight for happiness.

To fight, to fight for happiness. <|endoftext|> 
You stay with me, you are the heat in my night
As long as I live I live for you because I care about you so much

I remember how in love we were together, our first home, our first child
After all these years I feel so much more for you than I did at the beginning



You stay with me, you are my reason for living
No, I don't want to be without you, please always stay with me

To love is not to have to ask, never to say you're sorry
How long have we shared our lives, what we shared together is forever

You stay with me, you are the heat in my night
As long as I live I live for you because I so much, because I so much
Because I love you so much <|endoftext|>

Be with you forever

Forget that love

    Life is beautiful
    I enjoy every day
    Take a little, but also give
    Learn to live with a smile
    Life is beautiful
    Sometimes the sun doesn't shine
    Learn to forgive another
    Because that way you forget your grief

(Years)
They pass so quickly
(Together)
We both are
(Trust)
When someone builds on you
What you love so much

I've been whistling through life ever since you disappeared from me
because I can get along with myself
you said I had to change
but I just stayed
now I still have all that I have
and I remember what you never wanted to make again
no my life is no worse without you

refr.
      on my own in a double
      with a sea of ​​space around me
      on my own in a double
      on my own but I don't feel alone



I can sit comfortably in the evening
where I want to sit
and do what I want to do without you saying anything
yes, all that silence, you will not hear any criticism
and you love me nothing comes of me
I'm doing everything you never wanted to do with me
not a moment do I think about the past, not a moment do I think about then

refr. <|endoftext|> 
You wanted to be free, always be with me
You wanted to talk or you kept your mouth shut
I wanted to choose and not share
It was with you that I mostly found love

refr .:
    I'll always be there for you
    I will always be there for you
    Have the best time with you
    I always enjoy it with you
    I'll always be there for you
    I will not leave you alone for a moment
    I will give you all my love
    You will know that I mean it



They are just words without an ending
Because we are still together all these years
True love will never disappear
You make all my dreams come true with all your words

refr. <|endoftext|> 
I'm short of a thousand words
if I want to say what I mean
You belong with me, yes really with me
look at me and see what I feel
There is a language that you really understand
to tell you what it's all about
There is the honesty to get rid of my feelings
when it comes to my love

As long as there are stars in the sky
my great love will remain
As long as the earth will rotate on its axis
this will never end for me
As long as the moonlight will shine in the night
I will always remain faithful to you in my heart
As long as the stars twinkle in the sky
I will always say I love you.



All my thoughts are with you all the time
I can't ignore you anymore
I am not used to this. I've never known this
without you i'm so alone
There is a language that you really understand
I feel that when you talk to me
We have a lot in common and go through the rules
I see that this refers to love.

I scream my love for you from the rooftops
do anything to make you happy
And all I just want is you ...

As long as there are stars in the sky
my great love will remain
As long as the earth will rotate on its axis
this will never end for me
As long as the moonlight will shine in the night
I will always remain faithful to you in my heart
As long as the stars twinkle in the sky
I will always say I love you. <|endoftext|> 
We were watching some TV together, and the phone suddenly rang
You picked up the receiver and suddenly I heard a different tone from you
When I asked you who just called you said oh that was a friend
Maa rik suddenly felt such pain inside because of that one sentence

Because I see in your eyes that there is another
And I understand why I've been missing so much love from you lately
Yes I can see in your eyes that you cannot lie
Suddenly there is another man standing between you and me



At night I lie close to your side, dreaming, but in my heart I am far away
You didn't pay attention and I miss the words someone else says to me
But now that I know you mean it, I feel a lot more for you
And if you get back to what you used to be, I'll stay with you

Because I see in your eyes that there is no other
And I understand why I've been missing so much love from me lately
Yes I see in your eyes that you cannot lie
No There is no one else standing between you and me anymore

Because I see in your eyes that there is no other
And I'm sorry you've been missing so much love from me lately
Yes I can see in your eyes that you cannot lie
No there is no one else standing between you and me anymore <|endoftext|> 
I walk the gray streets
The light burns in every house
I feel all and abandoned
There is no home for me

I loved you so much all these years
But suddenly it was over
And every night I see again
How you smiled at me

refr .:
    I will never forget you
    You remain the one for me
    You remain the one for me
    Which I still love
    I will never forget you
    You remain the one for me
    You remain the one for me
    The woman I love



I can't be home alone at night
The walls then come towards me
So I run from myself hoping it helps
I feel like a coward

Those were happy years
But suddenly it's over
And every night I see you smile at me

refr. (2x) <|endoftext|> 
You took care of me like a mother to her child
You were not only my wife, but also my friend
Then that other woman came, I abandoned you
I repent now

I came back to you but you didn't care about me anymore
You then took off and everything seemed over
Come back to me, I don't want to live without you
Come back

refr .:
    Because I long for you so
    I can't miss you anymore
    You are the woman I love so much
    From the day you disappeared, things got quieter around me
    Without you I feel so alone



I hurt you a lot, you only loved me
And when you left me, yes, I felt the pain
Because without you I feel all alone
Come back to me

A new day dawns and slowly passes
I'm still thinking about tonight, you weren't by my side
I know you hate me, but it's my fault
It's too late now

refr. (2x) <|endoftext|> 
That time was beautiful
When we were in love and together
Still young and inexperienced
Like the storm, every hour passed quickly

That time was beautiful
But that happiness, those beautiful hours
Couldn't last forever



Chorus:
Whatever the reason
Yet you stay on my mind forever
And you remind me of those nights
Because that time has passed too quickly for us

That time was beautiful
The paradise we owned
Can't leave yet
I will carry that memory with me forever
You have remained that one true friend to me
I want to experience even more

Chorus:
Whatever the reason
Yet you stay on my mind forever
And you remind me of those nights
Because that time has passed too quickly for us <|endoftext|> 
It is hard to explain
what I think or what I mean
The words fail me
but if you feel what I feel

I want to share my life with you
I give my love with only one wish
My love is not like so many
no, my love knows no limit



When you feel what I feel
then let my wish come true
If you want to share your love
and will always be behind me

I want to share my life with you
I give my love with only one wish
My love is not like so many
no, my love knows no limit <|endoftext|> 
You will never come back
For me, it all happened so quickly
All those acquaintances who ask how we are doing
It's too late, it's too late



Chorus:
I tore up your picture
Burned your letters
I cry in my heart
But I am being casual
I tore up your picture
But I still see you
Because I know I'll never forget you

Oh, there is still hope
That you'll ever come back to me
Never, you said never
Is all that, yes just over <|endoftext|> 
I still think a lot
back to those days
which I experienced with you as a dream
You took me with you then
to silver beaches
There we lay ... all night ...

I will never forget that time again
in Playa Blanca
I will never forget that night again
with you on the beach
I will never forget that time again
in Playa Blanca
Will I ever see you again?
or is it over for good



Yes one day I will go back
to one of those beaches
Maybe I'll see you again then
But it's just a dream
I will not find you
But just maybe ... One night ...

I will never forget that time again
in Playa Blanca
I will never forget that night again
with you on the beach
I will never forget that time again
in Playa Blanca
Will I ever see you again?
or is it over for good <|endoftext|>

I sometimes can't say
this cannot be explained to me
I have never known a feeling like this

even though I don't see you often
but when I see you again
then it hits the spot

We are those people too
We also do not understand
How it is all meant

He came here on earth for 2000 years
It's been so long that he was allowed to be here
What has changed since he died then
Are we really satisfied, do we still feel his pain

War and peace always go hand in hand
He has felt this throughout the ages
We too are those people who play this along
We don't understand what he meant



It's so hard to live side by side
How much time does it take
Another 2000 years

He came here on earth for 2000 years
It's been a long time
May he be here
What has changed since he died then
Are we really happy
Do we still feel his pain

War and peace always go hand in hand
Through the ages
Did he feel this
We too are those people who play this along
We don't understand
what he meant

You brought me insecurity
You say life is a struggle
Sometimes things go wrong
You taught me that

You are always positive
You are so very sweet
Never speaks of another evil
Your friendship is worth a lot

For you,
I make a beautiful rainbow
For you,
Are all those stars never too high
For you,
A thousand roses are not enough
I make the gray sky blue
I do all of that for you

You often say: experience the time
Of being tired and lonely
Don't be ashamed, there will come a day
Then I hear your smile again



Luckily I met you
That makes up for every day
I can now handle everything again
And move on together

For you .....,
I make a beautiful rainbow
For you......,
Are all those stars never too high
For you......,
A thousand roses are not enough

It's a strange feeling
Since I know about you
That you are not at home here
And soon I'll be alone
And you forget our dream
It saddens me
I hope you see that
But for every tear
Don't you stay here

I would have liked to say something else
Want to explain to you
But it is no longer necessary
Although I have not cheated on you

Is our love really over now?
And you are no longer mine
If you don't want to talk now
and want to leave me
Then that hurts me

What you leave behind
It's a great time

I was cheated once too much.
Once too many times I've been hurt.
Even though you saw tears in my eyes.
You thought my words were just chatter.

All those beautiful dreams are a thing of the past.
Yes this storm is getting too heavy for me.
Because you with all those 1000 lies.
They are now tearing us apart. <|endoftext|> 
Everything, everything I wanted to do for you
everything, but you were all about my money
er, there will come a time when you will definitely regret it
of everything you did to me
it's too late so you can go

Chorus
Go away, I say you go away!
you've lied to me every time, bugger and cheated
go away, I say you go away!
It's over if you regret everything you've said ...




Gone, everything is over, everything between you and me
over, and after all these years I am free again
my heart was made of stone it was only because of you
you never knew that feeling
what kind of woman are you

Chorus (3x)
go away, I say you go away!
you've lied to me every time, bugger and cheated
go away, I say you go away!
It's over if you regret everything you've said ... <|endoftext|> 
Antonio was a very tough fisherman
he sailed the mediterranean
but when he came back home his heart melted
and he sang to his girl in the cafe

Come sing and dance with me, love will never end
oh ELeonora
come sing come with me the sun will shine again for the two of us
oh Eleonora

and one day they got married together
the village celebrated there in the square
Antonio looked his girl in the eye and sang the following chorus to her

Come sing and dance with me, love will never end
oh ELeonora
come sing come with me the sun will shine again for the two of us
oh eleonora



he then went sailing again, but he took his girl with him
and then resounded across the sea


Come sing and dance with me, love will never end
oh ELeonora
come sing come with me the sun will shine again for the two of us
oh eleonora

Come sing and dance with me, love will never end
oh ELeonora
come sing come with me the sun will shine again for the two of us

Jannes - Agree

When the rest of the night doesn't even know dreams anymore
And the light of the day no longer recognizes the sun
Life to you is like a sea full of tears
But luck awaits you, it's just that moment

Once then the sun shines again for you
Once then your sky will be a beautiful sky blue
Then there will come a day for you too
That life smiles at you



The feeling of your heart is the soul of the day
But a tear doesn't help you, so get that smile
All your pain that disappears and changes life
It is only that moment, but he chooses the day himself

Once then the sun shines again for you
Once then your sky will be a beautiful sky blue
Then there will come a day for you too
That life smiles at you

Once then the sun shines again for you
Once then your sky will be a beautiful sky blue

I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw you standing there all at once
Saw a thousand lights in your eyes
And they looked at me piercingly
Amor has fired his arrows
And it was hit in one go

I only thought about you all night
No more sleep
Since I saw you
If this isn't love
Then tell me what it is
That I am enchanted
Because of this smile
Hence this question
Please stay with me today
I would prefer you close to me forever

I only thought about you all night
I know I'm here waiting for you forever

When I dream, I dream of you
and see you next to me as my wife
ooohohohooohooho what am I doing

Chorus:
I want you a little bit more every day
My heart beats for you all day long
You drive me crazy, I admit
But that waiting makes me a bit tired
I want you a little bit more every day
Because when I think about you I get the jitters again
It drives me crazy, but then what should I do
I want you a little bit more every day

It may be a strange question
But I would love you today
ooohohohooohooho I can't wait anymore



tell me what you feel about me
and make me happy with your love
ooohohohooohooho and come to me

I saw you and was immediately upset
You were illuminated by the moon
It was really the best day for me
That will never go away
Remember what I told you
You belong exactly with me
Please give your love to me

Darling I need you so

Kiss me (kiss me)
You are the sunshine that shines for me every day

I will never forget your smile again

I once found my happiness with you
It was an endless flight, although that time flies quickly, yet you are still close to me here.
What would I be without you, all that thought hurts me. You are so special to me that is why I say with all my heart.

The whole world should know, I just can't forget you, because I love you as long as I know you I have no loss
I want to shout it from the rooftops. I keep sharing my life with you. As long as I keep dreaming of you I know what love is.

We now have a nice family, which is why I now sing to you. This is a song just for you because I love you so much. Although I am often away from home and I also come home very late at night. Burn a light in the window and you whisper my name very softly.

Sometimes I quickly think back for a moment
How I first met you there
I thought what a piece that is my luck
That's why I greeted you then
You smiled shyly and looked at me sweetly
Feeling never left

When I saw you, something beautiful was born in me
That had to be love
That had to be love
From that day on I lost my heart to you
I knew you had to be true love
You came here in my life right on time
You brought me good luck and sunshine

When I saw you, something beautiful was born in me
But I knew that must be true love

You don't know what love is
Dam Dam Dam Dam
I was wrong about you
Dam Dam Dam Dam
Everything revolves around you
Dam Dam Dam Dam
But now I forget what you say
Dam Dam Dam Dam

You can keep everything you have
I only take my clothes
Do not think that we are still getting married
Because that idea drives me crazy
Just go and cry at your mother
because I'm tired of all your tears
She may interfere with you now
I've really had it with you
First you want this and then that again
So there is always something
Yes, that nagging makes me crazy
So put my suitcase by the door



I tried my best for a long time
Dam Dam Dam Dam
But you often did not see me
Dam Dam Dam Dam
You do whatever you want now
Dam Dam Dam Dam
Because you are done with me
Dam Dam Dam Dam

Now that I'm a father
and know life.
Sometimes I think very quickly
those years back.
To that childhood,
that security.
Where I got love
for then and forever.

Only now I understand
what a concern it was.
To be a parent,
of a child so small.
Since I've gone
have you been there
And flown,
but I still fly to



'Cause where I was born
where my crib was allowed to stand.
There is my harbor, there is my harbor.
What you have given me
I take with me on my life path.
I carry it in my heart
I want to thank you for that.

Also the day after,
that my children go too.
I hope they often,
go back to their nest.
Just like I still do
to my parents.
it's my life
to my parents.

'Cause where I was born
where my crib was allowed to stand.
There is my harbor, there is my harbor.
What you have given me
I take with me on my life path.
I carry it in my heart
I want to thank you for that. <|endoftext|> 
I searched for love for years
And thought yes I will stay single
Until I saw you
Changed quickly
I want to wait a while now
And see you only once a week
At the farewell I am made of stone

Then I look at you for a moment
And don't ask you to leave
Then I sit here so alone
I want you close to me
Preferably all night
That even the moon is smiling
Because I've been so long right now
Waited with you



You promised me
To come back
But the wait that
Takes way too long
If you would know
How I long for you
Then maybe you came
A little earlier
I enjoyed it a little longer
Yours
When you go home, feel
I the cold

2x chorus:
Then I look at you for a moment
And don't ask you to leave
Then I sit here so alone
I want you close to me
Preferably all night
That even the moon is smiling
Because I've been so long right now
Waited with you <|endoftext|> 
COUPLET 1
------------

The evening awaits the two of us again
The day has no idea of ​​this
I better closed the curtains
Then no one is watching with us

You must look at me smiling again
My heart that cries you don't see a tear
You asked for time, but it takes forever
I have to let you go again and again


CHORUS
------

Our love remains a secret
Or do you really want to be with me?
Because if you just kiss
If no one sees us
Then you don't want more than this

Love sees no light with us
Only the night knows our face
It could be much nicer
With a little sunshine
I just want to be with you

COUPLET 2

Sometimes I think you forget me
You don't know about my sorrow
I'm alive, but everything is said with that
It's time you knew everything now

I'll show my tears from now on
Only then may you understand me
Will all that eternity come to an end?
Of that fight against time

It was in a country far from here
you got lost on the street
Your little hand asked me for money
I got angry then
I gave it everything I had then
never saw such a happy smile
and with a lot of pain in my heart I said goodbye

Amigo, adios little friend
you really didn't deserve the street
No love, no arm around you
there you are alone again
I will come to your back one day
and bring you a little luck
Then I'll make your dreams come true
adios au revoir



Adios, amigo little friend
you deserve a better fate
so very alone
Yes, I will definitely come to your back
and bring your hand full of happiness

gone forever ..
don't look around you
but look ahead ..
and then make a wise decision.

It was January, the snow was on the street, winter had just begun
Spring was approaching but only came in March the cold had not yet been overcome
It took a while, but the time has now come, although those months took a long time
The birds are singing, we go outside again, what have I longed for here

Chorus:

When the sun is shining
I feel a lot better
Then a laugh appears
I enjoy the day
I'm having a good time

When the sun is shining
I can take everything
Are people happy again
Yes that also applies to me
Go crazy

I'm looking for a nice terrace and drink a glass of beer
Watch all the people and have fun

When the sun is shining
I feel a lot better
Then a laugh appears
I enjoy the day
I'm looking forward to it

I get in my car my roof goes down
Now it is finally summer
A day in the sand for the sun and the sea
I've been dreaming about it
I lie in a beach chair with the sun on my head
Enjoy the weather
That wonderful summer has come again
What more does a person want now



Chorus:

You played with me now it's all over
Because you ended my dreams
The kisses of you the pledges of allegiance
Only comedy has gotten this far
Why, why were you so bad to me
Why, my love was so sincere
You played with me took another one for me
Everything is over for good now

That you cheated on me hurt me

I hope you know how much I love you and think about you

and tell her I love her
would keep watch over her
when I'm gone tomorrow



dear friends have passed away
which I have given too little
feelings not expressed
and kept silent about how much I loved them

and take every opportunity to say how much I love her

when I'm gone tomorrow

It's a shame that you won't be able to fish anymore
It's a shame you won't see an animal anymore
It's a shame all those trees without leaves
Yes, it is a pity, but it is true, otherwise not

When you see how this world is going to change
You mess, yes what should we do with it
It cannot remain on the earth either
So we just dump this junk in the sea



I wonder, maybe there is still something to be saved
That a child can still play outside in the future
And it turns green again, just like in the old days
I hope it is, but I don't notice much of it

Are you sleeping when I wanted to lose something?
I'm gonna wake you up to my regret.
I have to tell you I love you and I mean it.
Because alone is only alone.

Smoke a cigarette with me.
You just stay in your bed.
What I want to say is brief, but I mean it.
I'm so glad you're here.

I was single for years
Then sat alone, in a hotel
Because I didn't know what it was like to be in love
What am I supposed to do without you?

Kiss me and say you love me.
I wanted silver but now I have gold.
If you look at me I'm already getting weak, oh I mean it
What am I now without you?

Your eyes say so much to me.
When you open them you make me so happy.
I have to tell you I love you and I mean it

I never asked where had you gone
I was happy when I heard
your stumbling on the stairs
and you landed next to me at night
all this was a joke to you

I've always known
I never had you to myself
I always said this is your life
until you suddenly disappeared here

now i sit at home and think about the past
how it all started
you took me to all the pubs
and you knew I couldn't take it



I've always known
I never had you to myself
I always said this is your life
until you suddenly disappeared here

oooh ooooh ooooh

I've always known
I never had you to myself
I always said this is your life
until you suddenly disappeared here <|endoftext|> 
the mail brought me a letter
in which you asked me
please let me be free again
it was not easy
it was a blow
back what I used to do
I could go out alone again
sway and sway late in the pub
sometimes until after 4 and women enough

refrain
because I thought it was over
it really is for bee
there is really no going back now
for you and me
because I thought it was over
What have I done
you can't hear me anymore
now you can't see me anymore

as you went
you came back
you said I just had to get out
because it went much faster for me
but you never
never felt
that I would leave you
I really didn't mean that
1 tear in your eyes
a heart full of regret
we were outside ourselves
yes you wanted to lose me

refine

I tell you very honestly
you were my number 1
but since a few weeks
I am no longer alone
i met a girl
with a heart of gold
who wants to give me everything
and love me very much



refrain <|endoftext|> 
Who do I tip, not a penny?
Ha nice nix, because I got you through
You thought he'll take it
But I am a gambler, I know every game!

You go on, you go on like this
If you think you're cheating on me
Am I one step ahead of you now!

Did you really think, he doesn't see it? Haha!
But still, to your sorrow
I knew it had been for weeks
You draw the short straw, I'm not afraid!

You go on, you go on like this, haha!
If you think you're cheating on me
Am I one step ahead of you now! Come on! Yow!

You go on, you go on like this

Did you really think, he doesn't see it? hahahahaha!
But still, to your sorrow

I close my eyes and think
And then everything goes through me
Then I see my whole life
I enjoyed a lot, but also cried a lot
But I will never really regret that
It was always booze and friends around me
There were always parties
But it was life as I wanted it then
I had chosen that
We continued sometimes
The nights were long, then you fell into bed
Not a penny in your pocket, not a crumb left in the house
But you still kept smiling



I look back now, and yet I have no regrets
Those were good years
Because what I did, I never hurt anyone with it
It's my own life
I also don't understand what others are so concerned about
It's my life, the way I want to live it
I never argue, just leave me alone now

I live my life the way I want to
I don't interfere with anyone else
I live my life the way I want to
Let me go before I change now
Let me go now, let me go now <|endoftext|> 
When this day will soon be over
And I can get you again
Then you will be with me again
Pamper each other together
Nice that I got to know you
Let it be Saturday
Two days, oh they are so important
Because then you are with me
Always look forward to it
in the evening I keep looking at your picture
Then I can sleep peacefully
I know you are waiting for me

refr .:
   But I will reward you
   When we live together later
   Yes you will really see
   What I do for you
   Well it will only take a while
   Then you can experience something
   Really, your life changes
   You will soon see that



Waiting, that annoying waiting
You are on my mind
If only you were here now
I close my eyes for a second
Who never cheated on you
I only see pleasure
Two days, oh they are so important
Yes because you are with me then
Always look forward to it
in the evening I keep looking at your picture
Then I can sleep peacefully
I know you are waiting for me

I had to hear from the neighbors
That you suddenly disappeared
Bare walls are now at home
You're hard as rock
Take away everything
An empty house, a memory, a photo on the floor
Is all I have
You could have told me better
I would have let you go, but I would have known
Where you are now

I have to start over
What do I think this is mean
Still, I will continue to fight
I'll get over this too
How long then did you play comedy
If they had told me
That you would leave
I never would have believed that
The phone there I am staring at
But I don't know you're calling, maybe it's okay
I'm putting you out of my mind



You don't have to hide from me
I wear this like a man
Because of this I don't go to the buttons
You can really rely on that
I still have my hands anyway
With that I build on what you took from me
That's no problem
Maybe I should be happy
That you ran away
I don't make a point of just let me go now
I'll be fine, I'll be fine <|endoftext|> 
I've told you a fairytale of love
You thought it was so beautiful and you said
When everything becomes so clean in reality
Then you are happy and joyful
You then gave your heart to me with a kiss
And what I have promised I will do

I'll turn your life into a fairytale
A fairytale of love and loyalty
In it you will leave all over roses
Because I love you so much
The future smiles at us now
It's going to be a rosy scent and a mere shine
I'll turn your life into a fairytale
So that you will be happy

I turn our house into a beautiful palace
Although it may be a bit small
I'll treat you like a princess
Then the water tastes like wine to us
Because if you are happy then you are rich
And then your life is like a fairytale



I'll turn your life into a fairytale
A fairytale of love and loyalty
In it you will leave all over roses
Because I love you so much
The future smiles at us now
It's going to be a rosy scent and a mere shine
I'll turn your life into a fairytale
So that you will be happy <|endoftext|> 
Are you sleeping when I wanted to lose something?
I'm gonna wake you up for a moment
I have to tell you I love you and I mean it
Because alone is only alone

Come and smoke a cigarette with me
You just lie in your bed for a while
What I want to say is brief, but I mean it

I'm so glad you're here
I had been single for years
Was then alone in a hotel
Because I didn't know what it was like to be in love
What am I supposed to do without you?



Kiss me and say you love me
I wanted silver but now I have gold
If you look at me I'm already getting weak, oh I mean it
What am I now without you?

Your eyes say so much to me
When you open them you make me so happy
I have to tell you I love you and I mean it
Oh what do I do without you

Come and smoke a cigarette with me .........
Your eyes say so much to me .......
La la la la la la la la la ....... (2x) <|endoftext|> 
I can't live alone I would get lost without a wife
I have to live with someone but sometimes I just think why on earth with you
There are millions of beautiful girls meekly patient and faithful
I can choose another but would lose immediately I just can't do without you

You have changed over the years, I often see you late at noon
With those curlers in your hair even though you know I hate it
You grumble when I sit down to smoke, only think of your ashes on the carpet
You sigh how closely I have to cook again as if it were hungry winter

I can't live alone I would get lost without a wife
I have to live with someone but sometimes I just think why on earth with you
There are millions of beautiful girls meekly patient and faithful
I can choose another but would lose immediately I just can't do without you



And once I ran away I forged the door behind me
I roamed and drank until I was desperate and tired
There I stood shaky before your eyes thinking of course you become false
I really liked that then, but you fell sobbing around my neck

I can't live alone I would get lost without a wife
I have to live with someone but sometimes I just think why on earth with you
There are millions of beautiful girls meekly patient and faithful
I can choose another but would lose immediately I just can't do without you <|endoftext|> 
I look out on the street through the window
Are you coming or are you still angry?
Yes, I'll wait, maybe the phone will ring
I can hear the rain on the roof
I'm not comfortable right now
Every car that stops there
That can be you
Even the lights are already on
Please don't let me go
Please, you're not doing that to me right now

refr .:
   I can not forget you
   I think you'll be back with me soon
   I still think about you
   I'm not used to being alone
   I can not forget you
   A little fight and it's over
   No that cannot be true
   You were always everything to me



I'm kidding myself
Well, I too with my big mouth
It's a good thing no one knows
How I feel
Because they laugh themselves to death
Hoho oh well they think it's bad
But I'm not gonna say anything if you know what I'm saying
Yes I'm sorry for what I said
But maybe you'll come back to me
Yes I hope so because I can't live without you

refr.

All for me
All for me <|endoftext|> 
I should have seen it from that look in your eyes
I could have heard it from your voice
I should have felt it from the tension between us
Turns out I still don't know you

refr .:
    They say that everything will pass and that the pain will get used to it
    Yet I have always feared this moment
    But I let you go, I let you go
    I let go, I let you go



Your blurry look, not on me
I should have seen it on your face
I should have listened to the people around me too
Why didn't you say it right away

refr.

When I think of you or I dream of you
Then I live in the past
When I wake up here without you
Then I am shocked by the present
You're leaving me, I'm going to set you free
I let you go
I let you go <|endoftext|> 
It's an honor to fight for
The tricolor with orange vane
In victory and in suffering
To go to extremes
What in the world is more sincere faithful
Then between people and the red, white, blue?

I love you, my Netherlands
My homeland is full of glory
I love you, my Netherlands
My champion, my Netherlands

How wonderful it is to experience
Orange is togetherness
Which we all care about
Our pride through all time
Where in the world is sincere loyalty
Then between people and the red, white, blue?



I love you, my Netherlands
My homeland is full of glory
I love you, my Netherlands
My champion, my Netherlands

I love you, my Netherlands
My homeland is full of glory
I love you, my Netherlands
My champion, my Netherlands

I love you, my Netherlands
My champion, my Netherlands <|endoftext|> 
You left me
Yes, you left me so alone
And why, you wouldn't say that
You thought I was lying
That I keep cheating on you
I haven't been able to explain anything to you
Why, I thought then
I'll never get another kiss
You really didn't have to fear me
Don't trust me
Why didn't I know then
I have now secretly read your diary

refr .:
    Please come back
    Baby I love you so much
    Want to share my life with you again
    Will leave the glass
    Do not touch the bottle again
    Would love to caress you just like before
    I cried again last night
    That I traded you
    For those friends I went to party with
    Please come back to me quickly
    Because I secretly read your diary



I often run late now
And drunk on the street
I don't have any friends I can love
I regret that now
Lost everything with you
Have to rely on myself from now on
I was not listening
To your great sorrow
I really didn't know that at the time
You worried about me
No, you weren't happy anymore
I secretly read your diary

refr. <|endoftext|> 
The valley we were in, dear
You never had it that bad
Have often missed the boat
But you helped me out
And that was just in time
Oh what I said, you believed me
You really set me free in everything
Often you couldn't rely on me
That's why I'm so happy now
That you are still here with me

refr .:
   I'm staying with you
   For better or for worse, I will stay with you
   What would it be different here without you
   That's how I want to live, just with you
   I'm staying with you
   Losing you now, no I don't want to
   You who can laugh even when there was sorrow
   I will stay with you, really forever
   Ohohohohoh



The valley we were in dear
You never had it that bad
We have often missed the boat
You helped me out
And that was not on time
I don't know what to say
You're so nice, you're so good
I am so grateful to you for that
It's simple what I'm saying
But I love you so much

refr.

I will really stay with you forever
Hmhmhmhmhm <|endoftext|> 
As the evening lighting
Gives a clear picture
From the square where I lived then
The place where you have to live
I always keep coming there
To see how you give yourself away
I cannot say why this is so
It's like I'm dreaming
Love does not shine from your eyes
You're nice to someone else
But they have to pay
Nothing I can change anymore
You have to sell yourself
Your new friend has to live
I never wanted anything from you
No I just gave

refr .:
   Why didn't you want to live with me anymore
   You wanted to experience everything with me
   Even now I really want to forgive you for everything
   My door is open forever

Soon it will get colder again
Then it gets boring quickly
This life makes you older
Then you don't have to share anymore
Because he will soon have someone else
Can you forget everything
Now you are blind with love
But you can still know this

refr

 Why didn't you want to live with me anymore
   You wanted to experience everything with me
   Even now I really want to forgive you for everything
   My door is open forever





Still, I keep coming to watch you
I hurt myself but I have to see you

I dream of a Christmas in Holland
By moonlight in a clear night
With voices of children singing
A song that expects peace

I dream of the snow on the trees
the happiness of the domestic hair
To dream of Christmas in Holland
Is dreaming of the most beautiful in nature

Wherever I am in distant foreign lands
Or far out to sea in God's infinity
Wherever I stay on Calafornie beaches
I will never lose an image of home

An image of childhood years gone by
Became a dream I would never forget
A day that we were always together
Wherever I am I dream everywhere



I dream of a Christmas in Holland
By moonlight in a clear night
With voices of children singing
A song that expects peace

I dream of the snow on the trees
the happiness of the domestic hair
To dream of Christmas in Holland
Is dreaming of the most beautiful in nature <|endoftext|>

Every time
That I see
How you dance
And enjoy
Having fun with another
But I see
How you turn
Swings and swings
With those with you
Has big plans

refr .:
    Then I know, soon it will be over
    And you are happy next to me again
    So I ask, dance with me tonight too

Yes I know
The music
Is like wine
Which you don't
Can resist and you feel good
But I see
In the light
Your face
And you don't see me
Must look at you

refr.

Do you know how much I care about you
I don't want to lose you to anyone else
Why are you dancing until the morning light
You will regret it again in the morning



Yes, you dance
The whole night
And you smile
Because you know: everyone who looks at you
Every time
One asks again
Or you want
And you shine while I
Wanted to ask you too

refr.

Do you know how much I care about you
I don't want to lose you to anyone else
Why are you dancing until the morning light
You will regret it again in the morning

But I see
How you turn

You were so nice in the beginning
So sensitive and so tender
But there is nothing left of that
Yes you really changed that way
Can't even talk to you anymore
Then I see eyes that hate me
I could never have imagined this
I gave you love and gifts

You are hurting me
And I did not expect that
What's left of your friendship and your smile
You don't see me anymore
But still I stay with you

(Chorus)
Why don't you want to talk to me?
No, I don't want to lose you
I'm not leaving you alone
Even if you don't give me warmth and love
I stay with you, stay with you

I understand that I will have to sleep alone
It's okay if I can just see you for a second
Even though you've been gone so often, let me wait
I stay with you, stay with you
(End Chorus)

I wish someone could help us
To change the future
And forget the past
That's my wish, you should know that
But that will never happen
I promise not to whine anymore
Just have to get used to this life
And always forgive you



But it hurts I didn't expect that
What's left of your friendship and your smile
You don't see me anymore
But still I stay with you

(Chorus)

I'm not leaving you alone

I stay with you

So many beautiful words, you get used to them
Accord without lock, so you don't know the end

Only the language of our eyes
Tell you what love is

But one thing you must know
That there is someone for you too

[refr .:]
Once the sun shines again and you have someone around you
Everything is over, you are no longer alone
Once in your life you will be happy too
All those thousand tears will then have disappeared
Once the sun will shine again
There will also be that beautiful day for you
That life smiles at you forever



Living without love is like crying without a tear
That little bit of attention, the sense of our beautiful existence

But you can also burn yourself here
Does the fire seem to have gone out?

So much seems to have changed until someone believes you

[refr.] <|endoftext|> 
the world is empty, empty without you.

I close my eyes when I cry for you
I don't want anyone else to see me like that
because no one understands my sorrow anyway
always think come soon
oh the world is empty without you



(Chorus)
you, you, you, left me
and me, me, you left me so alone
you, you, you, did not stay true to me
oh the world is empty without you

you, you, you left me
and me me you left me so alone
you, you, you did not stay true to me
oh the world is empty without you
oh the world is empty without you
oh the world is empty without you <|endoftext|>

That bouzouki sounded through the summer night
Brought the two of us really close together
At night with a full moon
You looked at me
And then asked me spontaneously
Take me with you far from here

Lalalalala



That bouzouki sounded through the summer night
Brought the two of us really close together
Hand in hand together
Through Greece
That's where dreams came true
That bouzouki brought us together

In Greece
That's where dreams came true
That bouzouki brought us together

When night falls in the city.
She's looking for customers because she hasn't had anything yet.
She can buy that stuff again for a little money.
Even if she falls into the black hole.
Every car she keeps.
And she asks a man to come along.
What a night sees, daylight cannot bear.
Without love she went with him.

Chorus:
A girl is crying.
Behind a mask of a smile.
A girl is crying.
For what life has brought.
Sells her body.
Just for that white gold.
Does not know love.
No, no one who loves her even.
A girl is crying.
Her mind is empty. She feels sick.
A girl is crying.
Her clean bed became a porch.
What's left of all those dreams she had.
She is lonely and now roams the city.

When it merges with dense fog.
Because fate has long decided for her.
There is no one in the world who will ask.
Where that lonely addict girl is.



Chorus: <|endoftext|> 
Went to Milan for a week
And went all alone
I had even taken off my wedding ring
Sat smoothly through
I promised to be faithful
Will never let myself go
I blamed the wine
When I started to shake
But it was that Italian

I don't even remember what it was called, I lost it
But what do I care
It was Mario giseppe or something
But that is the name of the many

Every day that was the biggest party with him, I enjoyed it
But the pizza, the spaghetti and the wine
I miss that the most

I told you I couldn't stay
That was no problem for you
When you found my wedding ring in my bag
Did you tell about your wife
And you also had seven children
That was a small objection
I said give them my regards
I don't want to meet them, maybe until next year

I don't even remember what it was called, I've lost it
But what do I care
It was Mario giseppe or something
But that is the name of the many



Every day that was the biggest party with him, I enjoyed it
But the pizza, the spaghetti and the wine
I miss that the most (2x) <|endoftext|> 
Outside the violins bloom



The sun is high, it is a warm afternoon
I'm going to my dad in the nursing home
He's so alone, he's lost so much
His smile, his health, and his home




But outside the violins bloom, outside the organ man plays
But I know he can never, never enjoy it again
Once he was a strong guy, now he sits there pale and small
Outside the violets bloom, life can be sad

A hallway an elevator and then I see him
I walk over to him, he didn't recognize me
he doesn't say much but a little later I see
his look that says how nice that you are there

But outside the violins bloom, outside the organ man plays
But I know he can never, never enjoy it again
Once he was a strong guy, now he sits there pale and small
Outside the violets bloom, life can be sad

I'll take him and have a drink with him
And later we go around the block
Then it's time again, I'll take him to his room
I promise him I'll be back very soon

But outside the violins bloom, outside the organ man plays
But I know he can never, never enjoy it again
Once he was a strong guy, now he sits there pale and small
Outside the violets bloom, life can be sad <|endoftext|>

It's a lie

You're not the one I believed in.
Because you didn't give me anything you promised me.
All your life you would stay with me
But that turned out to be a bad dream for me

You're not the one I saw in my dreams.
You told me you would never come again.
Played a game, but with my life.
My future will be an illusion from now on.

It's a lie, I don't want to hear your words anymore
because you even swore to me that your love would be forever
it's a lie
my happiness was in your hands
I couldn't end up any worse
all the love you showed was only a pretense
It's a lie.



You're not the one you want to seem like.
You fall through the basket, you will now show that.
But you broke my heart, one day you have to pay.
The price of all my tears as you leave me.

You're not the one I could rely on.
Then why do I keep on loving you?
Is it because I don't want to believe
That everything you said just can't be true.

It's a lie, I don't want to hear your words anymore
because you even swore to me that your love would be forever
it's a lie
my happiness was in your hands
I couldn't end up any worse
all the love you showed was only a pretense
It's a lie.

It's a lie! <|endoftext|>

I give up my love
Trust and I will
Always with you

I found with you alone
I'm happy

The future is beautiful, for you and for me
It's a won'dre power
Which brought us together

When the marachi sounds

Viva lamore olee

I hear, hear the guitars
They sound for you and for me
Everyone is ecstatic
What laughter
Makes all hearts happy

When the marachi sounds
And Guan sings again
Then the party is for young and old
In the San Pedro square

I sleep on the clouds when you lie next to me ohoh ahah
Your thousands of words
Its like a poem ohoh ahah
I can't do a minute in my life without you ohoh ahah
I'll soon forget those lonely hours ohoh ahah

refr .:
    I find love with you
    With you I find happiness
    Those years that we've been together
    They go way too fast for me
    I find love with you
    I still enjoy every day
    Because of you I now live with a smile



My world changes when you aren't there ohoh ahah
Why haven't I known you much before ohoh ahah
I was looking for love the way to happiness ohoh ahah
A life full of tears is now over ohoh ahah

refr. (2x)

I do not want to lose you
Stay here forever
Your arm around me
Never leave me alone <|endoftext|> 
(Frans Bauer and Marianne Weber)

Let me know, I can't wait anymore
It's so cold, all my nights are lonely now
Tell me where you are
Please let me know
I have you, only in a dream

Please leave me a while and wait here for me
I now live in silence, all my nights are lonely now
It takes some time, uncertainty
I have you,. only in a dream



I have so many questions for you
I have no patience, where are you now
You belong in my life
So wait a minute
We go together again on the road to happiness

Even if they are just words
You can know them from me
You can hear them
No, I have not forgotten you
It takes some time, uncertainty
I have you, only in a dream

It takes some time, uncertainty
I have you, only in a dream

It takes some time, uncertainty
I have you, only in a dream <|endoftext|> 
(I walk you to the rainbow)
(We are surrounded by a flower eye)
(Where the seventh heaven waits)
(At the end of the trip)

In all my dreams I see your face
Not a night goes by for me
It's like you're lying here next to me
The gold I ever find is you
Looking for eternal happiness together
And our guide is our own feeling
A look in your eyes says more than enough
I really know what you mean now



[refr .:]
I walk with you to the rainbow
We are surrounded by a flower eye
There where the seventh heaven awaits
At the end of the trip
The road ahead is a ray of sunshine
It now points us to our ideal
That journey is like a fairytale night
To a beautiful paradise

When I change, I do it for you
You give my life another chance
You really have everything I love so much
With you I feel totally in balance
Sometimes I am not myself without you
Please, don't leave me alone anymore
But tears betray my silent sorrow
I want you very close to me

a mother's heart

Child come close to me for a moment

We share joys and sorrows together
Joy but also sadness


A mother's heart will always give love
A mother's heart still protects her child

Even though you have in life
Still done so much wrong
I will forgive you for everything
Always stand next to you
You can trust your mother
I keep every secret
The best thing that could happen to me
is to be your mother

    I was born to love you
    I was born to be with you
    I was born to belong to you

Sometimes you find it, sometimes you don't
But I had such a strong feeling
And when I saw you, then I knew; this is
What I have been feeling for years now



refr.

Life has been beautiful since you've been with me
No one was ever spoiled by life like us

I dream away a bit

    I'll sleep on the couch tonight, honey, you won't be right this time
    I'll sleep on the couch tonight, honey, because you're not kidding me anymore
    I'll sleep on the couch tonight, honey, you lied to me just one time too much
    And I have played too often for electric blanket

Every time you look at me I feel like a king, so rich
But my sober mind says: don't agree with her this time



refr.

Yes, you can talk well, everything that is crooked you can talk straight
But I'll never sleep with you again until you tell me the truth

refr. <|endoftext|> 
The days are getting longer, the clock is moving forward again
I get all that desire, I want to go out
The birds that whistle, the people are happy again
May to the end of August is the best time for me

refr .:
    It's summer again and then I'm going to have a good time
    Sunbathe, sit on a terrace and I have the greatest fun
    No, no routine for me
    Fourteen days without much hassle
    It's summer again and then I'm going to have a good time
    And I think long live the fun



I don't always have to go to Spain, the country with its ole
I also want to go to Zandvoort aan de zee in Holland
As long as the sun shines for me, I can handle life
I'm already getting the jitters again, so I let myself go

refr .:
(Once you come back)
    Say you love me
    Or am I kidding myself
    Is that the biggest mistake
(Every step I hear)
    I think "that's you"
    My heart is in my throat
    You pass my door

I ain't lying (he ain't lying)
I smile at every woman (smile at every woman)
But I never went too far
Because I love you
Now I'm alone (now I'm alone)
I made a mistake again (made a mistake again)
I feel what it is
Oh I missed you



refr.

It's over now (It's over now)
You're gone from me again (gone from me again)
I feel alone
Since you disappeared
It's my fault (it's my fault)
I never dared (never dared anyway)
You are gone
I think so over and over again

    Life is too good for tears
    There is so much worth it
    After every rain shower
    Is there a bird whistling again?
    Life is too good for tears
    There is so much worth it
    By being close to you
    Is every day just fine

You, I can watch you for hours
I feel so rich and warm inside
Oh what a beautiful day
I am so happy to live with you



refr.

We every moment I'm with you
I see all the beauty in things
Love that you give me
Makes me experience everything that way

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Six o'clock in the morning
The radio plays softly
My feet on the table
"I've waited so long
And called everyone out of bed
Our days are numbered forever

Ooh you
(What about you?)
Where have you been?
(what about you?)
Yes, where did you go?
(know that I love you)
But what about you?

The dog is sitting in front of the stove
He looks at me quizzically
But I don't know an answer either
Where did you go?
Then I am scared but not angry either
Oh, where can you be so late?

Ooh you
(What about you?)
Where have you been?
(what about you?)
Yes, where did you go?
(know that I love you)
But what about you?



Ooh you
(What about you?)
Where have you been?
(What about you?)
Yes, where did you go?
(know that I love you)
But what about you?

Seven o'clock in the morning
The newspaper falls in the hallway
The dog sleeping
It took him too long

Ooh you
(What about you?)
Where have you been?
(what about you?)
Yes, where did you go?
(know that I love you)
But what about you?

Ooh you

refr .:
    The whole train is singing: I'll never see you again
    No I'll never see you again
    One-way trip to solitude
    This train is going way too fast for me
    At the transition I see your face again
    I recognize you in every woman
    Once one way to the horizon
    And my train hurtles past a silent platform



I expected you to repent, but you said you are the way you are
I can't live without you and I don't think I get used to loneliness

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Without many words, she decided to leave me for good
Banged the doors, packed her bags, ended our happiness

refr .:
    Yesterday she left me, left me forever
    Didn't want to talk to me anymore, tell me where to go
    I've been building on her all these years and now suddenly it's broken
    For no reason, quite unexpectedly, the end came
    Gone, for you and me, this happiness



I shouted, shouted in tears, nothing could help anymore, I am alone

refr. <|endoftext|> 
(Koos and Dave Alberts)

I can't stand it when they talk about you
Because that really gets to me, it hurts me
I can't have it if they don't like you
Because I know how kind you can be
If they hurt you, then it really is of the (??)
Makes sense, because you are my own child
If they come close to you, then I'm on fire
And then I almost go nuts



refr .:
    You are my father and you are my son
    We are proud of that, and we just think it is
    You are special, you are a rock
    I go through thick and thin for you, and you for me
    You're my gabber, and you're my buddy
    You are already what you call a real comrade
    We have a good job together
    I will put everything aside for you at once

If something really bothers me, you are always there for me
Even though I'm still so tight
We neither have any secrets from each other
I'm honest with you too
You really are the rock that is always in the surf
Someone you can really rely on
You are now ready to go your own way
And believe me, well, I enjoy that

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes I think back and think, and then chase all my dreams
Success, much fame and years at the top, but this story suddenly ended
Because on that day when my luck crossed
My world collapsed, everything broke down
My life had changed, many friends acted differently
Just because of that one accident

But true friends have always remained loyal to me
And all those others no longer exist for me
I've fought for happiness I've given a lot
Where are all those old friends now
I know the good ones will never let me down
I shared those years with that love and leet
Because those who belong in my life, I will always love
True friends, even if there aren't many



Sometimes in my dreams I think back to when I could just do everything again
I have shared success with everyone, although I was sometimes played with
But I'd rather not think about this anymore
I will not get back what I had
I want to build my future and fight with confidence
That which has passed is over

But true friends have always remained loyal to me
And all those others no longer exist for me
I've fought for happiness. I've given a lot
Where are all those old friends now
I know the good ones will never let me down
I shared those years with that love and leet
Because those who belong in my life, I will always love
True friends, even if there aren't many
Because those who belong in my life, I will always love
True friends, even if there aren't many <|endoftext|> 
Every Saturday you are close to me all evening And the jukebox

And we dance all night and we whisper very softly at the jukebox

You take me home and we go home for a while until early in the morning
That's how it goes once every week we never get enough ggggggg!

I can still hear your voice the voice from your heart
Where have you gone now I feel alone
I am so confused
You were mine or is this over
Tell me where you are, you knew me
You are no longer free

I walk the streets and then look for you
I want to talk to you because I love you

It hurts so, not to be with you
You got out of here, you left me like that
I feel so small
I think of yesteryear, tell me when
You come back to me but do it quickly
And then never go again

I'm sitting here alone in my room, waiting
And listen to every sound
And sometimes it's like I hear you laugh again
But it's over, it's over
And when you finally come to collect your bags
I'll behave, if I may
But actually I would like to scream it out
"Give me one more chance"

refr .:
    Stay with me one more night
    Don't go to the other
    Stay with me one more night
    Before you leave me



It happened too much and right in front of my eyes
But I just didn't want to see
And now that you've cheated on me with my boyfriend
I may have earned it
Yes, to you I say: "I already have another"
I act cool and controlled
But actually I would like to scream it out
"What went wrong with us"

refr. (2x) <|endoftext|> 
I was young and I was walking along the harbor,
all alone lost my parents.
My father stayed at sea
and my mother withered away.
I then moved in with a skipper,
I asked him, say can I go
Now I sail just like my dad
and I am often at sea ..

Chorus

When I see the island
where I live on the waterfront
Where I was born, on beautiful Ameland
Where I spent my childhood
and have only thought of you in my heart
I felt at home, in my own house
where I find you
after a long journey ..

It was a night, the sea was restless
Waves crashed into our ship.
I thought of you you were so happy
and my son he can handle it
Fortunately the storm died down again
and then I realize how I desire
To that island in the North Sea
where I took you in my arms

Chorus

When spring comes I'll send you
Tulips from Amsterdam
When spring comes I pick for you
Tulips from Amsterdam
When I come again I'll bring you

A thousand yellow, a thousand red
Wish you the best
What my mouth cannot say
Say tulips Amsterdam

Oh Johnny, sing a song just for me
Oh Johnny, because you're number one to me
Sing a song with a smile and a tear
The whole Jordan sounds in your voice

Then I feel spontaneous
Open my heart
Oh Johnny for our Jordan

You don't have to say anything, no more explain
Because I can see in your eyes that you are sorry
We will stay together from now on, you don't have to be ashamed
Because everyone makes a mistake sometimes

refr .:
    If someone loves you it is worth living
    If someone loves you, they can forgive you too



Yes, you left me, we can talk for hours
But I'm glad you're back with me
You cheated on me, but = 82 = 82 a look in your eyes
Tell me do a hundred words

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes I miss you a little
but mostly I'm happy
that I have taken the step
It's good for both
I'm finally doing things
that I haven't done for a long time
I live my own life
way away from you.

Prefer to be alone and happy
then another day without a goal with you
Prefer to be alone and satisfied
then make love to you without fire and feeling
Sometimes I can't understand yet
that I did not free myself
I am alone now, but happy
happier than ever with you all this time.



I should have run sooner
I've wasted a lot of time
Free as a bird again
I always wanted that
The cage I lived in
it suddenly became too small
I couldn't take it anymore
to be your puppet.

Prefer to be alone and happy
then another day without a goal with you
Prefer to be alone and satisfied
then make love to you without fire and feeling
Sometimes I can't understand yet
that I did not free myself
I am alone now, but happy
happier than ever with you all this time.

I stroll through the city center
just a little while longer and the shops will close
and in a wide shopping street
I discover a familiar face
I am perplexed and turn around
you do the same and you are
in one step close to me and says
how good that you still recognize me.

How could I forget you
my prince charming on an old bicycle
You were my first great love
and I forgot nothing about that time
Your first kiss, our last school party
yes I was barely seventeen
although another came later
It's wonderful to see your back.

You say while you smile at me
I know a good and attractive restaurant
come along and we'll have a drink there
and you naturally take my hand
And just as carefree as then
I sit next to you on the terrace
You look at me and whisper softly
did you ever forget how beautiful it was.



How could I forget you
my prince charming on an old bicycle
You were my first great love
and I forgot nothing about that time
Your first kiss, our last school party
yes I was barely seventeen
although another came later
It's wonderful to see your back.

I have often thought about you
that I would ever meet you again
That I'm sitting next to you now
I never, never expected that.

Chorus:
I get a very special feeling inside
When you look at me sweetheart
What am I gonna do without you?
Can you hear the pounding of my heart?
I get a very special feeling inside
Even if I just touch you
Then it gets hot and cold inside
I cannot exist without you



The first love in your young life
Usually brings a lot of uncertainty
To whom should you give true love
With one you can easily lose those doubts
That's the real man
You don't understand how that is possible

Chorus <|endoftext|> 
Crying is too late for you, I'm not coming anymore.
Don't wait for me, it's the last time.
That you cheated on me, it's too late.
Because my love for you is now just hate.

I gave everything I had to you alone.
But you always went to the other person
I will never come back to you like I used to.
Crying is too late for you now, no I'm not coming anymore.



I hope you are happy with that other person.
I also knew those beautiful hours with you.
But one day the day comes for her like it is for me.
Because what you call love suddenly passes.

I gave everything I had to you alone.
But you always went to the other person
I will never come back to you like I used to.
Crying is too late for you now, no I'm not coming anymore. <|endoftext|> 
You left me alone
without telling me anything
Will you ever come back
because I still love you.

Once from you my love
once you were mine
You brought when you got home
Flowers for me.
But that did not last
You were not loyal to me
I found a picture of you
with that other woman.



You left me alone
to tell me something
You left me
without explaining anything
I'll see you again
or do you stay with the other
Will you ever come back
because I still love you.

You broke my heart
You've hurt me
I feel so cheated
that you left me like that
No, you weren't fair
No, you weren't faithful
Are all your flowers now
for that other woman.

You left me alone
to tell me something
You left me
Without explaining anything
I'll see you again
or do you stay with the other
Will you ever come back
because I still love you. <|endoftext|> 
You are the one I live for, how do I explain how much I care about you
The way you look, that says enough, you gave me more than I ever asked for

refr .:
    There are a thousand little things that make me love you
    Because of those thousand little things I always stay with you



For every gesture and word I know that you belong to me forever
I feel so good when you are with me, I love every moment so much

refr. <|endoftext|> 
You keep seeing it in the news
you see tanks and soldiers walking
A small child who cries
a mother's heart pops open
There is a lot of beauty that remains
which they do not enjoy
Because everything that blooms and lives,
is destroyed by bloodshed.

Amore, will conquer everything
Amore is in everyone's heart
Amore, how long will it take
Amore, how long will love be defied
Amore, a person needs nothing more
then Amore, be it yellow, white or black.



I'm sure one day
misery is part of the past
Nobody knows fear or pain
or thinks that was a long time ago
There will be peace then
You hear people laughing
after rain comes sunshine again
amore will wish that.

Amore, will conquer everything
Amore is in everyone's heart
Amore, how long will it take
Amore, how long will love be defied
Amore, a person needs nothing more
then Amore, be it yellow, white or black.

Amore, a person needs nothing more
then Amore, be it yellow, white or black. <|endoftext|> 
When I just got home then I saw
you stand and I thought
is there something at school or do you have
slept badly last night
Before I could ask you anything
you said I'm so upset
I wiped a tear from your cheeks
and said when I looked at you like that.

You can cry with me
You can take shelter with me
Your mother is there for you every moment
you will never be alone
You can cry with me
You can take shelter with me
We share a smile and a tear
I'll be there for you.



When I was your age now
I was madly in love
but one day that boy said
it's over for me
Thought I'd never smile again
I really didn't know what to do
I know what you feel but believe me
when I say the pain is gone.

You can cry with me
You can take shelter with me
Your mother is there for you every moment
you will never be alone
You can cry with me
You can take shelter with me
We share a smile and a tear
I'll be there for you. <|endoftext|> 
It was so ideal you were always with me
but your work often takes you away from home now
It's strange going to bed without you
do you still think about home so far away?
Thunder scares me, I imagine you
hold me in your arms for a moment
When will you sleep here with me again?
And then it will be just as usual
oh so far apart our nights are icy cold.

But we are both staring at the same sky
You and I always see the same moon at night
wherever you are in this world now
in my mind I will always be next to you.
I don't know when your back will come
Waiting for your return home is hard for me
but we are both staring at the same sky
the universe brings us together for a moment.



I don't know where you will wake up tomorrow
if you'll be alone like me
Life without you is really not easy
the fear of losing you hurts me so much.
But if you call me from a strange hotel
and says you still love me
then I don't hesitate for a moment
At the end of our conversation you say very softly
i'm just like you alone and lonely every night.

But we are both staring at the same sky
You and I always see the same moon at night
wherever you are in this world now
in my mind I will always be next to you.
I don't know when your back will come
Waiting for your return home is hard for me
but we are both staring at the same sky
the universe brings us together for a moment. <|endoftext|> 
I am dreaming about the old childhood years
Remind me my sweet mother her love that I appreciate so much
Day and night full of worries her sweet words her that one kiss
Felt safe and secure I really like to think about that

You were always there, to this day
You were always there, answering my question
You were always there, my mother my girlfriend
You were always there, with your love I love so much

The first steps I learned are to comfort myself when I fell again
That way you crept in to represent that feeling that you loved me
Dear mommy after all these years, I am grateful and so happy
That I can always hide with you the sweetest mother that is you

You were always there, to this day
You were always there, answering my question
You were always there, my mother my girlfriend
You were always there, with your love I love so much



Your arms like wings, protective and soft
Steering like reins that's how you raised me

You were always there, my mother my girlfriend
You were always there, with your love I love so much

You were always there, with your love I love so much

It was a fisherman from a village on the Mediterranean
I met on vacation
And in the evening we danced together in a small café
I was in love I remember it so well
He promised to write to me when I said goodbye to him
But he may already have someone else
Every night I still think about that village by the sea
But I will never see that fisherman again

Chorus
Adio Adio Adio fisherman with your raven black hair
Adio Adio Adio maybe until next year

Think back to that little cafe where the two of us sat
We danced there until the middle of the night
And drank red wine there by the Mediterranean
I had not thought of a goodbye
 I've only got a picture of the two of us in the sun
Where I could laugh with you back then
But next year I'm going back where I met you
Where our beautiful adventure began



Adio Adio Adio fisherman with your raven black hair
Adio Adio Adio maybe until next year

He promised to write to me when I said goodbye to him
But he may already have someone else
Every night I still think about that village by the sea
But I will never see that fisherman again

I remember how I met you
then that day
and what struck me so much was your smile
You asked me to go with you
to a very nice cafe
Then life changed for the two of us

When you look at me like that
I feel oh so rich
To live with you
that makes me happy
You're the man for me
that came into my life
Say that you Love Me
and never leave me alone



We have been together for years now
with the two of us
but once a year you ask, are you coming with me?
Then I already know where we are going
to that little cafe
that's where life changes for the two of us

When you look at me like that
I feel oh so rich
To live with you
that makes me happy
You're the man for me
that came into my life
Say that you Love Me
and never leave me alone <|endoftext|> 
Under my heart, a miracle lives deep inside me
It's still very small, but it is both
A gift that love gives to us
And so on living in love

It is a feeling you cannot describe
It's a secret between you and your husband
But one day, it will be in my arms
Tenderly soft and small

Miracles will always exist
Miracles until the world is gone
You and I are part of that too
That's how you see what love can do



Just be patient and you'll be by my side
I'll see you then and your sister will be there
And I take care of her child like any mother
That it always finds love with me

Give it a chance, for luck and security
Give it hope again, for a better time
I made a promise to my baby here in me
When you come, the violence is over

Miracles will always exist
Miracles until the world is gone
You and I are part of that too
That's how you see what love can do
Miracles will always exist
Miracles until the world is gone
You and I are part of that too
That's how you see what love can do
That's how you see what love can do <|endoftext|> 
The evening that awaits you again
and then smiles at us
I soon forget the morning
Although I don't know how
Because at dawn
Blame the night
I feel that emptiness again
And ask me for patience
Lots of patience

All stars will be silent when you go again later
The light that goes out when you leave me
I will live with what you left here
Love but also a lot of sorrow
But nobody sees that

All stars will be silent when you go again later
The light that goes out when you leave me
If only you could always be with me
If only our love wasn't a secret
Never again will silence be necessary

If I have the time now
Could stop
Because every time I wonder
If you're gone why
Because at dawn
Blame the night
I feel that emptiness again
And ask me for patience
Lots of patience



All stars will be silent when you go again later
The light that goes out when you leave me
I will live with what you left here
Love but also a lot of sorrow
But nobody sees that

All stars will be silent when you go again later
The light that goes out when you leave me
If only you could always be with me
If only our love wasn't a secret
Never again will silence be necessary

If only you could always be with me
If only our love wasn't a secret
Never again will silence be necessary <|endoftext|>

The women are all from Venus, which seems to me to be a wonderful planet
To sneak a look around without anyone knowing
Although many less walk around here on earth, you do not know what you see
As a child I learned to look yes is healthy, you are doing nothing wrong with that

One who may have too big a butt, another has braces in her mouth
There are also those who want everything with you or they only eat healthy
The one who has glasses and red hair, the other is a real sweetheart
But the most beautiful thing is deep inside, they are all equally dear to me

I really don't have to bring it up at home when I tell you what I've seen again
She thinks I flew to Venus or might be in a midlife crisis
But men hunt with their sharp noses, they just look around
But sometimes they miss their target because of the wrong choice, they quickly find something beautiful

One who may have too big a butt, another has braces in her mouth
There are also those who want everything with you or they only eat healthy
The one who has glasses and red hair, the other is a real sweetheart

It takes some getting used to,
that you are not here anymore.
But I know I did well.
Though the nights are lonely
I don't have a single cent.
You know why I left.
You had no more words to say to me.
Because everything you did was a game.
Without explaining a single thing.
You took me from heaven to hell.




Everything you said
every word of yours that was lied.
Everything is over.
you cheated me one time too much.
Now let me go
I don't want to share another moment with you.
What you did
that's playing with my heart and love.

Adios my darling,

Not a day goes by that I don't think about you anymore
to all the sweet things you have given me
you were the sweetest in the whole world
the girlfriend of my dreams that I will not forget my life

adios my darling
I only have your gold ring
that makes me think again and again
to the love of you my favorite
adios my darling
I often think about those years
that the two of us were together
I with you my dearest darling



it only hurts
when I think of you again
I wonder if you realize what you did to me
I thought I would stay with you for a lifetime
happy to dream together
but those dreams have gone with you forever

adios my darling
I only have your gold ring
that makes me think again and again

No one I can ever tell this
together we carry a great secret
in my mind you are always with me
that eases that silent pain for me I would like to share everything with you
but it is much too early for that
no i will never play with feelings
because I already have enough misery

when evening falls for us
Then just stop time today
because I've longed for this so much
but you will answer my question later

love brings me close to you
tonight we are very close together
and all my beautiful dreams come true
when evening falls for us

don't be angry but don't let me choose yet
please give me a little time
because I certainly don't want to lose you
but I live inside with a lot of regret
just look very deep into my eyes
that betray what I feel for you
no I've never lied a word
only you know what I mean by this

when evening falls for us
Then just stop time today
because I've longed for this so much
but you will answer my question later

love brings me close to you
tonight we are very close together
and all my beautiful dreams come true
when evening falls for us



and all my beautiful dreams come true
when evening falls for us

I look into your eyes the doubts I see about you
you feel so insecure you know how much i love you why you make me wait, the wait takes so long
and the fact that you can't choose that scares me so much

Refr
All or nothing, you have to choose
I don't want to lose you, I love you too much
All or nothing it's in your hands, I feel the passion burn
It's all or nothing



You don't want to commit even if your heart says yes
I can't own you but you don't want me to go now
your smile tells me everything and finally you say something
That you choose for both of us because alone you will find nothing

Refr
All or nothing, you have to choose
I don't want to lose you, I love you too much
All or nothing it's in your hands, I feel the passion burn
It's all or nothing

When I saw you for the first time
I was still looking for my self
You beamed and looked at me smiling
You find me with that look
Like a spell
I found myself with you
I often think about that moment
You caressed my feeling
What I had not known for so long
I had another life purpose
An angel heard my dream
Ohhhhh mi amor



Aaaaaa
A a a a a

I now live in paradise
I hope an eternity
Your house is like a beautiful palace
I never want to lose you
And you believed in me
And in both of us
Therefore sing to you in this song
Not a word is too much for me
It says how much I love you
And share my heart with you
I do not want you to go
Because I can't live without you

Aaaaaa

Jannes - A gram of luck

Love can be special and beautiful
Even if you are prey now and then
What you have given, you don't often get back
So you keep looking for happiness
Until the day you find the one
And you commit to love
Then you say everything together, we share joys and sorrows
I want you never to forget

That which is mine is all yours
And want to share it with you
Because a gram of luck brings more than gold
I will not let that steal me
Every day your smile brings me a summer day with sunbeams
What you give what you bring is not payable at all
So what's me is all yours too
It's love for life
And believe me no I will not say this so easily, only to you



It may be an old-fashioned story
But to me love has a moral
It's taking but also giving
You only know that you succeed
If you go for everything

That which is mine is all yours
And want to share it with you
Because a gram of luck brings more than gold
I will not let that steal me
Every day your smile brings me a summer day with sunbeams
What you give what you bring is not payable at all

So what's mine is all yours too
It's love for life
And believe me no I will not say this so easily, only to you
That which is mine is all yours
And want to share it with you
Because a gram of luck brings more than gold
I will not let that steal me
So what's mine is all yours too
It's love for life
And believe me no I will not say this so easily, only to you <|endoftext|> 
From Today (Duet With Peter Beense)
D. Wagner / F. van Weert / W. van der Heijden
BME Songs

When friends ask me to go out
Then I always like to go with them
And do I come home at night my mommy asks
You must be from the cafe
Then I look deep into her eyes
And I say, no really not my dear
I've lied before
But it was so nice in the city

Chorus:
From today I will never go out alone again
Then we go together nicely
I'll take you to the cafe
Starting today, I'll take you with all my friends
Then we go for beers together in the pub

But arrived at Mel's in the evening
A cafe in our street
There the music comes from a jukebox
How wonderful that that still exists
The people there are still happy
Uncle Jan is dancing with Mel
Eating nice beers together
I ring the bell again



Chorus:
From today I will never go out alone again
Then we go together nicely
I'll take you to the cafe
Starting today, I'll take you with all my friends
Then we go for beers together in the pub

The jukebox will play the last song
Uncle Jan is already wearing his jacket
The taxi is already waiting outside
But my wife doesn't want to go yet

Starting today, I'll take you with all my friends
Then we go for beers together in the pub
Then we go for beers together in the pub

I remember how that one night
She passed by so sweet and soft.
She passed by in my most beautiful dream.
Unfortunately it was short lived,
But a very nice adventure.
In my most beautiful dream she came to me!
She came to me.

Guitars rang through the night, she was so sweet and soft.
Her black hair danced in the wind.
With so much passion and full of fire, I long for every hour.
but that most beautiful dream who would have ever thought that.

Black hair, Sultry guitars,
Red lips kissed me softly.
She suddenly disappeared from my dreams
Suddenly very deep in the night.

From that first sultry night,
She already has me in her power.
No, that dream will never end!
Even if only for a short time,
I don't dream of her every hour.
Would she be the one for me? Yes to me.

Guitars rang through the night, she was so sweet and soft.
Her black hair danced in the wind.
With so much passion and full of fire, I long for every hour.
but that most beautiful dream who would have ever thought that.



I want to go back to my dreams.
I want to go back, get back to her quickly.
Or would she ever, ever come to me.
Will my dream ever come true?

Guitars rang through the night, she was so sweet and soft.
Her black hair danced in the wind.
With so much passion and full of fire, I long for every hour.
but that most beautiful dream who would have ever thought that.


Black hair, Sultry guitars,
Red lips kissed me softly.
She suddenly disappeared from my dreams
Suddenly very deep in the night.

Black hair, Sultry guitars,
Red lips kissed me softly.
She suddenly disappeared from my dreams
Suddenly very deep in the night.

You shouldn't cry
Adio amore adio

What I have from you now is a thousand dreams
Even if I now have to say goodbye, you're fine!

You shouldn't cry
Because one day the sun would shine for us forever
This goodbye is only for a while so dry your tears now
Adio amore adio

Take you as a souvenir in my dreams
Even though I am far away I would watch over you
And in a while we will be back with 2!

I sat on a terrace
I didn't know where you were.
Then you passed there.
And you didn't even look at me.
What have I done then.
Where did it go wrong.
You're the one for me.
The only one for me.

Chorus:
Kali, I miss you, Kali.
Most beautiful woman of my dreams.
I love you, love you!

Kali, my dearest Kali.
I want to share everything with you.
I love you.


You went with my best friend.
What did I deserve that from.
You got what you wanted.
But now I'm out in the cold.
I'm asking you again now.
Try again.
You're the one for me.
The only one for me.

Chorus:
I look you in your beautiful blue eyes.
We are together on the boulevard.
The sun that shines we drink a tequila.
I gently stroke you through your hair.
I would like to say one more thing to you.
That I want to be with you all my life.
My heart racing when you look at me through those eyes of yours.
I get itches in my stomach when you look at me through those eyes of yours.

At the bar, there is a man.
Who can no longer run from the drink.
You smile at me, I take your hand.
We toast together on the waterfront.

No work and no money
I was never a hero in life
you were there for me but never thought about you
I now repent of that
but I turn the tables
I don't look back at all my best friends
feel cheated because they loved my money
why was I so stupid

yet you remain faithful to me
you kept telling me there is one who loves you
i have no money but i am rich with such a woman
you are the friend i trust oh oh
so honest and sincere
one who fights for her husband and for her children
well, I'm not that bad with you
What should I do without you

I was a selfish person
who never missed his wife and his own children
I was always gone
was always in the pub
no, I never had enough



yet you remain faithful to me
you kept telling me there is one who loves you
i have no money but i am rich with such a woman

In Amsterdam in a cafe
I ran into you and said hey
Dear darling, would you like something to drink?
You looked at me and I saw
your white teeth that beautiful smile

and I asked you for your name
my heart just kept skipping
until you said

I want to know you
that's what you said then
you are the love of my life
you make me oh so happy

Went on vacation again this summer
To the Spanish sun
And still remember very well
How that vacation started

I saw you walking there then
There on the warm beach
You smiled at me, you felt free
And you took my hand


Chorus:
Oh Magdalena,
The sun always shines with you
I wish I was forever
and could stay forever

Ohohohoooh Magdalena,
Here with you I feel free
I want for all my life
Still be with you forever


It was two very nice weeks
My vacation was over
I remember very well
What you said to me then

Now that I've found you
I will never leave you again
You smiled at me, you felt free
And you took my hand




Chorus:
Oh Magdalena,
The sun always shines with you
I wish I was forever
and could stay forever

Ohohohoooh Magdalena,
Here with you I feel free

In our cafe, it is cozy, come and sing along
People dance at the bar here, everyone
In our café, it is cozy, come and party
You will find a good friend here, you are never alone

I met you a long time ago
Here in this little cafe
You were singing in a black hat
And everyone joined you

It was so nice that night my friend
I asked you: sing along with me
We sang late into the night
And everyone joined us

In our cafe, it is cozy, come and sing along
People dance at the bar here, everyone
In our café, it is cozy, come and party
You will find a good friend here, you are never alone



You too sing a song with a smile and a tear
That affects people the most
The night is our life, that is our existence
And there is a big party everywhere

“You just think” and “Kali” that was our luck
We never expected that
Yes, it is nice here again my friend
We sing late into the night

In our cafe, it is cozy, come and sing along
People dance at the bar here, everyone
In our café, it is cozy, come and party
You will find a good friend here, you are never alone

In our café, it is cozy, come and party
You will find a good friend here, you are never alone
You will find a good friend here, you are never alone <|endoftext|> 
I'm Coming Home (At Christmas) Django Wagner



I'm coming home
With Christmas
I can not wait
to be with you
it will not take much longer
before I get to you
and then I stay
very close to you
I'll be there
with Christmas
you show me
that I really care about you
it will not take much longer
before I get to you
and then I stay
very close to you
I think of you
you are in my thoughts
I'll be there
because you kept waiting for me
in an hour
I hold you in my arms
What I did
no I never do that again
We are together now
with Christmas
you and me
that feels so good
you and me
together forever
yes i stay
very close to you
Yes I stay
very close to you <|endoftext|> 
Every hour of the day
That you are here with me
I see your beautiful smile
I think about that beautiful moment again

When I met you, that one time
I still remember it well
I'll never forget that

I get butterflies in my stomach when I look at you
My heart immediately races when I see you
I get itches in my stomach, very deep inside
You are my greatest dream, my most beautiful fantasy

Never leave you alone again
No, I don't think about that
You are my number one
Will never let you go

When I met you, that one time
I remember it well
I'll never forget that



I get butterflies in my stomach when I look at you
My heart immediately beats when I see you
I get itches in my stomach, very deep inside
You are my greatest dream, my most beautiful fantasy

Will always stay with you
Because I love you so much

I get butterflies in my stomach when I look at you
My heart immediately races when I see you
I get itches in my stomach, very deep inside
You are my greatest dream, my most beautiful fantasy

You are my greatest dream, my most beautiful fantasy <|endoftext|> 
I often think about that night.
you sat there with a stranger in a dark brown cafe.
I was totally upset.
because you went with the other.

those beautiful eyes have deceived me.
and for lied, can't believe it.
I've been waiting for you all those nights.
but you never came home, i really had it.

get out of my life.
you have nothing to give me.
you cheated me.
from that very first day.

those beautiful eyes have deceived me.
I've had it, I'm more than fed up with it.

I never expected this.
Now you pick up your suitcase and go back to that cafe.
I've waited too long.
you go with the other.



those beautiful eyes have deceived me.
and for lied, can't believe it.
I've been waiting for you all those nights.
but you never came home, i really had it.

get out of my life.

the day I saw you
and you looked at me
I had never known that one moment
I didn't know it existed.
it made me warm
it didn't let me go
I stood next to you
and touched you
and you left


before I could say anything
you were gone again
now i think about you every day
in that one moment when I saw you

I'm waiting here
maybe you'll come
that one moment I knew I will never forget
i hope i meet you again
even if you don't say anything then I still get something out of that one moment



before I could say anything
you were gone again
now i think about you every day
the one moment I saw you

I'm waiting here
maybe you'll come
I will never forget that one moment I knew.
I hope to meet you again.
even if you say nothing then I still have something that one moment.

before I could say anything
you were gone again
now i think about you every day
that one moment I saw you.
wooooww that I could say something
you were gone again.
now i think about you every day
in that one moment when I saw you

that one moment ... <|endoftext|> 
Is it night already, only a quarter past eight
I've lost time since you left here
Days so long, oh I'm so scared
Where are you now, because I was shocked to death
Your promises keep haunting my mind
It was love after all, I believed you for nothing

refr .:
    I am so lonely now that you are no longer next to me
    I can still feel your hands, I can still see your face
    We were drunk with happiness
    Before I knew it everything was broken
    There was enough room for you here in my arms
    I'm so lonely now that you don't love me anymore
    I can only hope you still find your way
    Am I just a waste of your time
    I'm losing you forever now
    But you should know that I still love you



Is this our house? I don't feel at home
It's been so different since you left me
What do I do, you talked about loyalty
Gave you my love, it was to no avail
Your promises keep haunting my mind
It was love after all, I didn't believe you for anything

refr.

But you should know that I still love you <|endoftext|> 
It's been a long time
that I met you here
but the feeling never disappeared
it still feels so good every day

I get such a nice feeling with you
you know exactly what I mean
you make me happy every day
and you give that feeling to me

you make the sun shine again for me
and every dark cloud disappear
with you I don't know what I'm missing
because you know what love is

I often think about all those nights
that I've been waiting for you
I lived in uncertainty
but I have now lost that feeling



I get such a nice feeling with you
you know exactly what I mean
you make me happy every day
and you give that feeling to me

you make the sun shine again for me
and every dark cloud disappear
with you I don't know what I'm missing
because you know what love is

I get such a nice feeling with you
you know exactly what I mean
you make me happy every day
and you give that feeling to me

you make the sun shine again for me
and every dark cloud disappear
with you I don't know what I'm missing
because you know what love is

with you I don't know what I'm missing
because you know what love is <|endoftext|> 
You are well, I will miss you
That was the last thing you said
We shared joys and sorrows together
Is that all over now?

Especially at night, it is cold and dark
It's harder for me than I thought
To have to come home
When no one is waiting for you there

refr .:
    I'm so lonely without you
    You should know how much I love you
    Why did it have to come to this
    What's left of those dreams
    We have nothing more with each other now



We didn't have time to talk
Is it too late now? I lost you
Can't get you out of my mind
I can still hear your voice, how you laughed
Why is this over now

Well, we argued a lot
Nobody wanted to be the least
We both lost
All that's left is pain

refr.

Is this over <|endoftext|> 
When I was a kid
You always took me with you
Taught me to walk on your hand
You showed me everything in the world
You allowed me to stand on my own two feet
Oh, it is so unprecedented that you are my father

You were my great hero
But had I done something wrong
that look of yours said much more than a thousand words
You showed me everything in the world
You allowed me to stand on my own two feet
Oh, it is so unprecedented that you are my father

If I needed you you were there for me
All my tears dried with grief
You always put your arm around me
You caught me when you needed to
Gave me good advice when I was hurt
Always a listening ear, because that's what fathers are for

If You Can't Choose
D. Wagner / F. van Weert / W. van der Heijden
Publ. BME Songs

At night I hear you softly come in
And you crawl very carefully into my bed
You kiss me tenderly without saying anything
I've already set the alarm
When I ask you where you come from
Then you say nothing and turn around with a sigh
I never get an answer to my questions
Something's wrong, I'm not stupid

Chorus:
If you can't choose
Go to the other then
Yes I gave everything you asked
Maybe I'm wrong
That there is another
Where did that beautiful time of ours go?
Maybe I'm wrong
That you love someone else
If so then you have to tell me
You still have a lot to explain to me
If you want to go, pack your bags




Sometimes I feel so empty when you look at me
There's something you don't want to tell me
The truth is what I want to hear so badly
You've been so quiet for months
When I ask you where you are going
Then you say nothing and turn around with a sigh
I never get an answer to my questions
Something's wrong, I'm not stupid

Chorus:
If you can't choose
Go to the other then
Yes I gave everything you asked
Maybe I'm wrong
That there is another
Where did that beautiful time of ours go?
Maybe I'm wrong
That you love someone else
If so then you have to tell me
You still have a lot to explain to me
If you want to go, pack your bags

Maybe I'm wrong
That you love someone else
If so then you have to tell me
You still have a lot to explain to me
If you want to go, pack your bags

The clock that strikes, this will be the last round
Yes I have to close, it's time to leave
Well come on, but this is really the last
No Uncle Jaap, the billiards is closing
It's really done

Empty your glass, go outside
Because the waiter wants to go home
Yeah it's time, I can't help it
But there is still someone at home
Yes it is time for everyone
That I want to send you away
But it is time, high time
Yes it is time, high time

Yes I understand, it is very nice here
But I'll be open tomorrow
Then I'll be here again
There you have Cor, of course he wants to pop
But his daughter Anneke
Luckily already paid



Empty your glass, go outside
Because the waiter wants to go home
Yeah it's time, I can't help it
But there is still someone at home
Yes it is time for everyone
Not that I want to send you away
But it is time, high time
Yes it is time, high time

Empty your glass, go outside
Because the waiter wants to go home
Yeah it's time, I can't help it
But there is still someone at home
Yes it is time for everyone
Not that I want to send you away
But it is time, high time
Yes it is time, high time

High time
No Cor don't do it now
High time
No yes the billiards is closed
We are not going to play billiards tonight anymore Jaap
Over, close Jaap
High time
You know what, I'm going home. You just look at it <|endoftext|> 
Hey, I'll walk you a bit
Hey, I never dare to ask you
Hey now you say yes or you say no
If you reject me, I will not complain

I've seen you pass by here so many times
Then I whistled at you but you didn't look at me

Hey, come with me for an hour
Hey then I can talk to you for a minute
Hey I know a very nice brown cafe
Because you know baby I've been eyeing you for so long



Come on, you can't leave me now
Because I've been waiting so long for this

I've seen you pass by here so many times
Then I whistled at you but you didn't look at me

Hey, I'll walk you a bit
Hey, it's getting dark in the streets
Hey you like it so don't say no
Hey I just want to talk to you

Hey, I'll walk you a bit
Hey, I never dare to ask you <|endoftext|> 
You never once had time for me
Worry about us
Living together is long over
Don't know how it happened

You and I grew apart
You took different paths
What ever blossomed in beauty
Doesn't make any sense to me now

(Chorus)
No I don't care anymore
Whether you leave me
you have been doing for years
Whether I no longer exist

You pack your things
You know where to go
You hurt me so much
I live without you from now on
I can manage on my own
(End Chorus)

Friends said, no this won't last
She always goes her own way
And she slowly pushes you aside
I saw her with another man



(Chorus)

You hurt me so much
I live without you from now on
I'll be fine
Only.... <|endoftext|> 
he looks for their own father
he never knew it
his mother is silent when he asks her
please let me talk to him
why should I hate him
at school he was always teased
he wants to know the truth and cannot forget
there is a father and he lives
but he wants to know where
he's been looking for 20 years
who is my father he keeps thinking


he has been looking for their own avder for so long
his mother is silent why is she so afraid
no no one opens up and it hurts
how will she really be a father
I know nothing
that's all he hears
that hurts him he is murdered inside
no nobody wants to tell the truth
I do not know why
yes once the bomb bursts


he searches all the cupboards and sometimes he finds a trace
but as always it comes to a dead end
am I made out of love or was it just a quick one?
there are no photos she tears up
sometimes he looks in the mirror like who I most resemble
and then he is really upset for hours
he just wants to know
and then you will forget that will be his best day for him




he has been looking for their own avder for so long
his mother is silent why is she so afraid
no no one opens up and it hurts
how will she really be a father
I know nothing
that's all he hears
that hurts him he is murdered inwardly
no nobody wants to tell the truth
I do not know why
yes once the bomb bursts <|endoftext|> 
I know you are for hire ..
For a small amount per hour.
I'd like to hire you for life.
They come right there with you.
For some attention from a woman ..
But I am too proud to donate.

The night changes everyone.
But during the day, yes you sit there alone ..

I see the red light ..
The curtains are closed for me.
I know you're lying there on your bed ..
With those guys around you ..
I feel I have to walk.
Because I don't want to buy you ..
Still, I will wait a little longer ..
On a glimpse of your face ..



I see them standing there horny ..
Every night in front of your window ..
They come out laughing.
They're drooling like an animal.
Why do I care about you ...
Why am I out in the cold ...
you should know that i'm crying ..
If they've been with you ...

The night changes everyone.
But during the day yes then you sit there alone ..

I see the red light ..
The curtains are closed for me.
I know you're lying there on your bed ..
With those guys around you ..
I feel I have to walk.
Because I don't want to buy you ..
Still, I will wait a little longer ..
On a glimpse of your face .. <|endoftext|> 
Oh, it's getting late, I have to go now
But not until I have said
I'm calling (he's calling)
It was great and besides
I would like to see you again tomorrow
Oh I'm calling (he's calling)

And take you to my cafe
Then I can show you off to my friends
You and I are really going to experience something
But then for a long time, no, not for a while
What I feel now is unprecedented to me



I really had never been here
I really have to go, party enough
But I'm calling (he's calling)
I looked at you and you at me
We approached slowly
Yes, I'm calling (he's calling)

How long have I waited for this
It's been an eternity for me
You and I are really going to experience something
But then for a long time, no, not for a while
What I feel now is unprecedented to me

Forget that grind, open your door
To start a new life together
You and I are really going to experience something
But then for a long time, no, not for a while
What I feel now is unprecedented to me
What I feel now is unprecedented to me <|endoftext|> 
I've been sitting here for hours now
I look on the street through the window
I know you're not coming, but I have hope
it rains, and the drops, I count them on my window
I don't get far, because I keep hearing your name
it's cold without you
but still I remain faithful to you

Chorus:
I don't have to tell you I love you
if you look in my eyes that says enough
do I always have to tell you:
Darling I love you!
I gave you everything you asked me to
it is quiet
alone in the house
please come home anyway

I don't have to tell you I love you
if you look in my eyes that says enough



night has fallen
the lights are already on
another long night lies ahead of me
how long will this take
my windows fogging up
I slowly write your name with my fingers
it's cold without you
but still I remain faithful to you

Chorus. <|endoftext|> 
The innkeeper pours some more,
and then look at his clock
it's time,
everyone quickly empties their glass,
the last one is tapped,
a jukebox that suddenly stopped.

It is high time there is a shout
from the corner,
the receipts are ready,
may I pop tonight,
a man's voice asks,
you pay tomorrow.

It's time, it's high time
you will be thanked for another evening of fun,
bye madam and bye sir,
you will come here again.

The bell is being called
the last one is mine,
then we'll go home quickly
+
well ahead the very last
-
who thinks of me
I also have a house.



At the table in the corner
there is a man sitting alone
and stares straight ahead,
soon he will soon be forgotten again,
he thinks where can I go
I have no red penny.

It's time, it's high time,
you will be thanked for another evening of fun,
bye madam and bye sir,
you will come here again.

The waiter calls come on now people,
it's about time
I also have a family,
because she knows what time we close,
i'm coming home late
I can't go in anymore.

Another joke and a laugh, then it's over
the thing that is now empty,
empty bottles and some peanuts are on the floor,
the jukebox that suddenly stopped.

It's time, it's high time
you will be thanked for another evening of fun,
bye madam and bye sir,
you come here again. <|endoftext|> 
It does not matter
That you don't want to see me again
No really that doesn't matter
Because I can't forget you
Well it doesn't matter
I know you'll be back here later
It's my fault, I spoiled you
It does not matter
That I have to wait for you
No really it doesn't matter
You know I will forgive you again
I know I can't live without you
Without you ... Without you ...



It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
I have patience, yes I can wait
So it doesn't matter
Ah well that I have lost you now
I can't bother about that now
Because soon you will be here with me again
With that everything is over
It's okay, oh it's okay
It doesn't matter to me now
I am waiting for you
I can't forget you anymore
You may know that from me now
Even if I have to wait for you for months
No it doesn't matter

Ooh, I know I can't live without you
Without you ... without you ...
It doesn't matter, oohh it doesn't matter to me now
I am waiting for you
I can't forget you anymore
You may know that from me now
Although I have to wait for you for months
No it doesn't matter <|endoftext|> 
It is no longer necessary
How the hell could I trust you
It is no longer necessary
The fire that was in me has now gone out
You don't have to say anything
What you still want to say is not interesting
Now go away
It is no longer necessary, just let me do it

refr .:
   A new life can begin
   It's not too late, I'm still young
   Nothing to lose, just win
   You always said I couldn't win
   A new life can begin
   You will see that I can get very far
   Without regret I see you go
   I see a world opening up for myself



It is no longer necessary
Now get your stuff and disappear
Don't want to hear anymore
This house is too small for you and me now
You don't have to say anything
What you still want to say is not interesting
Now go away
It is no longer necessary, just let me do it

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Why why did this have to happen to me
So many words without content
So many words, so much pain
What seemed so beautiful all these years
A few minutes then it was over

Yesterday I was your love
Now you say you hate me don't want to see me
Just some words I said but don't mean
I'll take them back but won't leave me

Yesterday I was your love
Now you say you hate me don't want to see me
Have you forgotten all those years with me
This will not pass for those words



Yes I know, yes I know I have my mistakes
Compare them with the good
What then weighs most for you
Don't leave for a few words
Which I said but still don't mean

Yesterday I was your love
Now you say you hate me don't want to see me
Just some words I said but don't mean
I'll take them back but won't leave me

Yesterday I was your love
Now you say you hate me don't want to see me
Have you forgotten all those years with me
This will not pass for those words

Yesterday I was your love <|endoftext|> 
You say I'm free, but you mean I'm so lonely
You feel bad, you say, but I am not dreaming
Because those looks in your eyes say everything to me
I feel just like you, so you can be honest
You feel very good, you say, your mouth starts to vibrate
I know I can help you, but you have to want to
Do each other a service now, that's all I'm asking
Now put that fear away, I already knew it's my day today

Now give me your fear, I will give you hope in return
Now give me the night, I'll give you back the morning
As long as I don't lose you, I will find the way with you



Now look at me, no say nothing, you can keep quiet
It's still tough now, but I know I can get you
This never has to happen again if you stay with me tonight
Because then you will see, when you wake up later that you are smiling again

Make me feel like I belong again from now on
I'm going with you because I'm never going to let you go now
Now give me your fear, I will give you hope in return
Now give me the night, I'll give you back the morning
As long as I don't lose you, I will find the way with you

Make me feel like I belong again from now on
I'm going with you because I'm never going to let you go now
Now give me your fear, I'll give you hope in return
Now give me the night, I'll give you back the morning
As long as I don't lose you, I will find the way with you
With you with you with you <|endoftext|> 
All passed so quickly
For a moment I had you with me
It went so fast I had no time
To ask oh stay with me

You're gone, it's quiet around me again
It takes some getting used to because I am alone again
Yet I will never forget you
I think over and over



You shouldn't have told me
That you love me
Then I could have said now
Go leave me cold
Believe me believe me
This passed too quickly
If you just came to say I'm free

Oh I hope you will call
And then tell me honestly
Why you left
Because then I know what I've done

You shouldn't have told me
That you love me
Then I could have said now
Go leave me cold
Believe me believe me
You shouldn't have told me
That you love me
Then I could have said now
Go leave me cold
Believe me, believe me, believe me <|endoftext|> 
Who do I tip, not a penny?
Ha nice nix, because I got you through
You thought he'll take it
But I am a gambler, I know every game!

You go on, you go on like this
If you think you're cheating on me
Am I one step ahead of you now!

Did you really think, he doesn't see it? Haha!
But still, to your sorrow

I wanted to share life with you
I could handle anything with you
Your eyes turned me on
I floated to the moon
I felt it wrong then, that's how you never meant it
I was too religious you just needed me

I don't want to see you anymore
I hate you anyway
Just get out of my sight
Don't think I'm giving in to you anymore

Why weren't you clear
I feel so used
As a pastime you were bored you exploited me
And I fell for it
In my head and with all my heart
My eyes closed to reality

I don't want to see you anymore
I hate you anyway
Just get out of my sight
Don't think I'm giving in to you anymore



If only I had known
Then I would have left
Now it is so sudden
And it hits so hard

I don't want to see you anymore
I hate you anyway
Just get out of my sight
Don't think I'm giving in to you anymore

Just go away <|endoftext|> 
I said goodbye and thought
There goes my whole life
I turned around
That you couldn't see my tears
You knew what I felt
It has always remained that way
Yet the moment came
That I couldn't give you anything more

refr .:
    Go, you might find your way back one day, but go
    Although that seems very stiff, oh go
    Close your eyes, keep yourself stupid
    Go and forget

Don't look back



One kiss that was enough, and I said
Have you forgotten anything?
And that this made no sense
Like my indifference
A goodbye that hurts
So I should have known
You take time with you
Which I will never forget

refr.

But now that you really do
Gonna disappear forever
It seems like I'm falling into the deep end
You leave a void in me
Which no one can fill
I'm not saying anything, you know I'll miss you

Forget about me now, go
If you ever find your way back, go
It's over, it's dark, go <|endoftext|> 
Your parents don't let me see you again, Eleonora
While I'm so good to you, Eleonora
It's so hard to live without you
Because you are what I love so much
It's so hard to break up with you
Because if I do that, I also break my heart
No without you that's not life for me

We will continue, with the thrust of the mild force
to carry on, in the speechless night
We shall go on
We will continue until we are together

We will continue, with the wavering certainty
To continue, in an endless time
We shall go on
We will continue until we are together



We will continue with the sweat on our faces
To go on alone, in a trench without light
We'll keep going, we'll keep going, until we're together

We will continue every time we stop
To go on again, naked in the hurricane
We shall go on
We will continue until we are together

We will continue if no one is expecting more
That we carry on again, on a speechless night
We shall go on
We will continue until we are together

I sit here all alone, celebrating Christmas.
I have finished the punishment I deserved.
I stole for our family
but that made no sense.

Because you are now celebrating Christmas with someone else.
How could you forget me so quickly?
Why is there someone else in my chair now?
I am so lonely here, in that cold, chilly cell.

Can't you really understand what I'm feeling?
Now you are sitting at the Christmas tree with someone else.
My children who sing Silent Night.
Yes it will certainly be quiet to me.

With nothing to ease my grief.
My fellow humans received a package.
With the Christmas wish "Father come home soon"
I didn't get mine, that makes me very sad.



Not being welcome in your own home.
Maybe I can give my kids some more.
What to give from the bottom of my heart.
I can't forget, that's why this Christmas song.

A song so full of sorrow.
No candles will burn here for me.
I feel like a Christmas tree without a peak.
I feel so alone, where am I going to go anyway.

In my mind I hear Christmas music.
I sit here all alone, celebrating Christmas.
I have finished the punishment I deserved.
I stole for our family, but it was no use.

Because you are now celebrating Christmas with someone else.
Maybe I can give my kids some more.
What to give from the bottom of my heart.
I can't forget, that's why this Christmas song.
A song so full of sorrow. <|endoftext|>

Ramses Shaffey and Liesbeth List - Together in the sea.
You know I'll have to cross over later
but you're not coming with me heehee.
you know far too little about ebb and flow,
and that's why you don't dare.
Your ship is already ready,
and you're still waiting for me
but I dare not go along yet.
I'm afraid of the storm
and the changing tide,
no, I dare not go along yet.
Forget your mind and give me your hand.
No, I don't dare to go yet.
And now follow your heart to the other side
come adventure and come along.
You know about everything that ties me so here
Come on you come with me hee hee.
But I'm not used to the storm and the wind
and fear the sea.
Also remember the time when I will not be here.
No, I don't dare to go yet.
At home the water flows and I pour wine here,
do not fear the sea.
Forget your mind and give me your hand.
No, I don't dare come along yet.
And now follow your heart to the other side
come adventure and come along.
I look along the quay and there comes a dot.
Yes, I will go with you.
I report and become your sailor on the ship.
yes i will go with you.
We together we sail the horizon
yes, you come with me hee hee,
The sea rhymes with no, but my heart now says yes
I dare, I will go with you.
Forget the stories, the grind of the country.
Yes, I will go with you.
you're coming with me across the street.
And together we choose sea.
(R.H.) <|endoftext|> 
Andre hazes - lonely without you!

You are doing well I will miss you
That was the last you said
We shared joys and sorrows together
Is that all over now?

Especially the night it was cold and dark
It's harder than I thought
To have to come home
When no one is waiting for you there



Chorus:
I'm so lonely without you
You should only know how much I love you
Why did it have to come to this
What's left of those dreams
We have nothing more with each other now
We didn't have time to talk
Is it too late now? I lost you
Can't get you off my mind
I can still hear your voice how you laughed
Why is this over now

Well, we argued a lot
Nobody wanted to be the least
We both lost
All that's left is pain <|endoftext|> 
When I look at you, I have no control over anything
I feel drifting away, I dissolve
I am in front of you, shy as a child
I overflow endlessly, endlessly

When I look at you, I have no control over anything
I swing through the streets like a disco dancer
I stand before you, trembling with gratitude
I overflow endlessly, endlessly

And then in the bath, don't laugh, I'll kiss your feet over and over again
You breathe as if you are sleeping, but you are not sleeping
I say out loud: How beautiful you are
You laugh because I used to
Made a song about two decent ones
Old ladies in the bath, saying to each other
How beautiful we are
How beautiful we are both
We don't regain consciousness

Then we are quiet, you touch me
I'll kiss your feet forever
We turn on the light and have a cigarette
And get dressed to have a coffee somewhere
To stand still against you at the tram stop
Hearing the cars go by with your eyes closed
And the voices of people, footsteps, the bikes
To stand still against you forever



To then smile a little later
The first side street to turn into
To then lie against you in bed with open eyes
You think I'm a little boy
You stroke my nose, my head, my hair
To lie still with you forever

You joke to me about you later
Prepare a peanut butter sandwich
And tomorrow I can go to the playground
Because one day you will be gone
To lie still next to you for an eternity
And until then you want to give me everything

When I look at you, I have no control over anything
I breathe you in until I can no longer
I'm still with you
I flow into you endlessly, endlessly

After dying for a moment
I give you back to nature
I give you back to your dance among the people
I'll help you back to space
And freedom and spring
With all my heart I help you back to you
You are so quiet

When I look at you, I have no control over anything
You radiate under your skin at night
Open, without defense
You overflow endlessly, I love you endlessly <|endoftext|> 
Tell me it isn't
Tell me it isn't
Tell me it's not true (1x)

Are you coming to our favorite restaurant tonight?
A table for two
I called, they know about it
And we drink until the sun comes up
And we forget
The dishonesty of fate

Tell me it isn't
Tell me it isn't
Tell me it's not true (2x)



Let's go put on your coat
Otherwise it will be too late
Come here
I'll hold you, I'll never let you go
And I'll tell you a joke that makes you cry with laughter
And we forget
The looks of the people in the city

We pretend it isn't
As if it is not so
As if it is not true

We pretend she just lives on
As if she just lives on

Even if it isn't <|endoftext|> 
My sky blue with golden halls
My cloud towers, ice crystals
Comets, moons and planets, aah everything revolves around me
And through the white cloud gate to deep under the waves
My fire, my love, drills itself into the earth
And a child is playing by the water
And all the shells it finds shine when I smile.

I like your warmth on my face
I like the copper color of your light
I'll give you water in my hand
And shells from the salty sand
I love you so sweet

I tear the rocks with my rays
Increase the lakes in the valleys and
Thunderclouds I make flee, aah when the rain falls
Hide your eyes in my hand
Before my smile burns them
My fire, my love, my golden eyes
Better if you wait a little longer
Because a little later night comes and the cool moon shines

The night is too cold, the moon too gray
Please take me to your heavenly palace
There I want to be just with you
And shine in the sky blue
I love you so sweet



When I'm going to heat the earth
I let her live in my arms
From stars I wove the distant, aah the northern lights
But sometimes I'm like swirling lead
I am life and death
In fire, in love, in all times
My child I ask you, look up
Today I span my rainbow
It is only for you

No I never stop for a second
I'd rather burn take me
No one can force me when I don't want to
When you go to sleep in the sea tonight
Not a life that I didn't start
And fly along your celestial orbit
You can't love the sun
I don't want to leave you anymore

I love you so sweet
I love you so sweet
I love you so sweet
I love you so sweet
I love you so sweet <|endoftext|> 
On the land, in the meadow and
in the woods, on the beach
I want to enjoy myself now
with Marije by my hand.
My Mary is so chubby,
is so woolly, is so soft.
My Marije is so mad
and fun in the night.

Hosja, come on Marije.

On the water, in the puddles
in the rain, in the wind
I want to wash my Marije
because she likes it.
I want to decorate my Mary,
I dress my Marije fur.
A thousand roses, carnations,
a thousand kisses on her mouth.



Hosja, come on Marije.

I let my Marije run
through the waves of the sea.
Then roll through the dunes.
Ah Marije, I'll take you with me.
My Mary in the heath,
in the clay so muddy.
My Mary in the meadow,
my Marije in my bed.

Hosja, come on Marije. <|endoftext|> 
I may have been born too late
or in a country with a different light.
I always feel a little lost
although the mirror shows my face.
I know the pubs and cathedrals,
from Amsterdam to Maastricht.
Still I'll get lost every day
that keeps things in balance.

LET ME, LET ME, LET ME GO MY OWN GOAL.
LET ME LET ME, I ALWAYS DONE THIS.

I won't forget my friends
because whoever is dear to me, remain dear to me.
And where they live I had to know
but I lost their last letter.
I will still meet them
maybe today, maybe in a year.
I'll kiss and greet them
it will happen again by itself.

(Chorus)



Luckily I'm not anchored
sometimes I live here, sometimes I live there.
I haven't anchored my life
I have no possession and no objection.
I love water and earth,
I like cheap and expensive.
There's not a penny I saved
I just live from hour to hour.

(Chorus)

I will also die sometime,
I really cannot escape that.
I'll just let my songs roam
and further you figure it out.
For now I'll still be your singer
your black sheep, your loyal fan.
I will stay a long time, and preferably even longer,
and let me stay who I am.

LET ME, LET ME, LET ME GO MY PROPERTY.
LET ME LET ME, I ALWAYS DONE THIS.
LET ME, LET ME, LET ME GO MY OWN WAY,
LET ME LET ME, I ALWAYS DONE THIS. <|endoftext|> 
You only live a very short time
Only once.
And if you want to change it later, you can no longer.
Man, dare to live.

Don't ask every day,
of your short existence.
How did my dad and my grandpa do.
How does "˜t my cousin or how" ˜t my friend.
And who knows how or that will find the neighbor again.
And what decency has written for.
Man, dare to live.

The people determine the color of your tie,
The shape of your hat,
And the snipe of your coat.
And of your life.



They point out the paths along which you are allowed to go.
And they shout oh shit if you stop for a moment.
They choose your future, they choose your work.
And they pick you a pub and a church,
And what to give to the poor.
Man, is that life?

The people they prescribe your rules of life,
They advise you and they shout in unison:
So, you have to live.
You can deal with that,
But you can handle it, but it is too little.
And you should marry them if you don't feel like it.
And you have to live there. That demands your decency.
And you will be ignored if you were to do otherwise.
As if you had done something bad.
Man, is that life?
Life is wonderful
Life is Beautiful.
But fly out in the sky
And don't crawl into a cage.
Man, dare to live.

With your head high,
And nose in the wind.
And slay your boot
how someone else thinks.
Keep a heart full of warmth,
And love in your chest.
But be a ruler on your square meter.
No one else can give you what you are looking for.
Man, dare to live.
Man, dare to live <|endoftext|> 
It's quiet in Amsterdam
The people have gone to sleep
The cars and the bikes
Are lifeless things
The city still belongs today
To a few individuals
Like me
They like deserted streets
To just say out loud
To be able to talk to yourself
To be able to sing out loud just like that
Because the cars and the bikes
Are lifeless things
When people have gone to sleep
It's so quiet in Amsterdam
And thank goodness no one
I came across

It's quiet in Amsterdam
The people have gone to sleep
I light a cigarette
And look at the water
And think about myself
And think about later
I look at the clouds
That exaggerate
I'm so scared then
That the loneliness will remain
That I will always walk like this
At impossible hours
That I'll get used to it
That this will continue
When people have gone to sleep
It's so quiet in Amsterdam
I wanted
That I finally met someone <|endoftext|> 
When it storms around your ship
Come along, come along
With the storm that takes you to a wild sea
Because the power is too great
And your boat is too small
And time will turn the tide again

When it storms in your head
Come along, come along
With the storm that takes you to another deer
And don't resist the grief
Because time will turn the tide again



Because the cliff does not move
And the wind does not move
Your ship is about to list
Because the storm will not pass
The violence, danger and fear that come with it
Your cry for help is part of it
Now clear the sails

When it storms in your heart
Come along, come along
With the storm that takes you to a wild sea
Do not deploy the anchor
Don't save your skin
Because time will turn the tide again ... <|endoftext|> 
It's five o'clock
5 hours
The party has been
The sun is rising in the city
I'm standing in front of the window
And have a drink
My heart is full

My head is soft
My friends
It's okay
If it goes
And we have to keep going anyway
Hello dear people
Where I belong
I'll let you out
Go ahead



Maybe I was a little quiet tonight
There is something
That I now want to tell you
My love
My love will not come back

That's all
Now go quickly
Because it's 5 o'clock
Already 5 hours
The party is over
I'll get it done
It's a bit rotten now
Without hair
But go away now
And let me ...
Braboos <|endoftext|> 
I loved you more than you might think but everyone went their own way someone you saw someone kissing a day later than your love was so real

now i'm lying here waiting for the morning to come and when i sleep i can only dream of you you cried goodbye to us but your sorrow didn't last a lonely night and a tear on every cheek

it was hard to say goodbye but you thought it was better this way and just wanted to be alone for a while now you're with the other while I die my hours in silent sorrow and loneliness

now i'm lying here waiting for the morning to come and when i sleep i can only dream of you you cried goodbye to us but your sorrow didn't last a lonely night and a tear on every cheek




now i'm lying here waiting for the morning to come and when i sleep i can only dream of you you cried goodbye to us but your sorrow didn't last a lonely night and a tear on every cheek <|endoftext|> 
You stand there every night
The neon light shines through your hair
I'd love to talk to you
Oh well, just ask something unimportant of you
To me you are not just any woman I look at
You're one of those women I succumb to

A woman from the life
Earns her money on the street
A woman from the life
Still, I'm glad it exists
A woman from the life
There she is in the cold
A woman from the life
Don't know how much I love her



When it rains I never see you hiding
It hurts me then I can cry
I'm sure if I would say that
You walk away and laugh at me
No to me you are not just any woman
There are already so many of them
A lot of men see you as their wife
But I also want a part

A woman from the life
Earns her money on the street
A woman from the life
Still, I'm glad it exists
A woman from the life
There she is in the cold
A woman from the life
She doesn't know how I love her

A woman from the life
Earns her money on the street
A woman from the life
Still, I'm glad it exists
A woman from the life
There she is in the cold
A woman from the life
She doesn't know how I love her
How I love her
How I love her <|endoftext|> 
I was at a party the other day
it was quiet and not so nice
but suddenly uncle Keesie called
say my lips get itchy
if I don't get a beer soon
then I go to the pub
because there I think is
I think enough beer

[Chorus]
o a beer a beer a glass of beer
that always goes in
a beer a beer a glass of beer
I have such a sentence
come give me another beer
my glass is already empty
it's beautiful with a foam head that I just got there
it's beautiful with a foam head that I just got there

now I may say
never annoying with the drink
and when the party is over
I'd like to say a word of thanks
but then all that talking
I'm still thirsty again
and we all sing
we sing with full breasts



[Chorus]
o a beer a beer a glass of beer
that always goes in
a beer a beer a glass of beer
I have such a sentence sentence
come give me another beer
my glass is already empty
it's beautiful with a foam head that I just got there
it's beautiful with a foam head that I just got there

I would like to wish
that beer comes out of my tap
and then for all my people
I leave it open
no foam that of a zebra
but pure beer foam
I would then shower for hours
hours of shower of pleasure

[Chorus]
o a beer a beer a glass of beer
that always goes in
a beer a beer a glass of beer
I have such a sentence
come give me another beer
my glass is already empty
it's beautiful with a foam head that I just got there
it's beautiful with a foam head that I just got there
it's beautiful with a foam head that I just got there
it's beautiful with a foam head that I just got there

A tulip is much more beautiful than an expensive orchid
if only it is given out of love
A tulip is much more beautiful than an expensive orchid
Because it is not written anywhere anyway
That the price determines the proof of love
Whether you pay with a cent or with a tenner
A tulip is much more beautiful than an expensive orchid
As long as it is given out of love

The world can be cold, it revolves around money
They should have it if necessary by force
But one thing is certain and that gives me hope
The love that is real cannot be bought

A tulip is much more beautiful than an expensive orchid
if only it is given out of love
A tulip is much more beautiful than an expensive orchid
Because it is not written anywhere anyway
That the price determines the proof of love
Whether you pay with a cent or with a tenner
A tulip is much more beautiful than an expensive orchid
As long as it is given out of love



They are dissatisfied, they want more and more
Those who have a lot always look down on less
But if you take a really good look at people
Then you know that money does not enrich the world

A tulip is much more beautiful than an expensive orchid
if only it is given out of love
A tulip is much more beautiful than an expensive orchid
Because it is not written anywhere anyway
That the price determines the proof of love
Whether you pay with a cent or with a tenner
A tulip is much more beautiful than an expensive orchid
As long as it is given out of love <|endoftext|> 
For years you were my gabber
like a brother i loved you
I can still see you there on the sidewalk
you were shivering from the cold
Without a house and without money
you even lost your wife
I said come and live here for so long
but I regret that now

That's why I helped you out of the gutter
was your friendship not so great
How many times have you been there in my bed
You never saw your boyfriend's wedding portrait on the wall
then nothing really went through you,
are you so hard and so mean
But everything is over, you took her away from me
it's a shame, our friendship is over



I never asked you a nickel
that you ate was normal
even if you wanted to go out once
I gave you some of my wages
I gave you everything, even my clothes
because a friend will not let you down
have you forgotten everything
why did you do this to me

That's why I helped you out of the gutter
was your friendship not so great
how often have you been there in my bed
you never saw your friend's wedding portrait on the wall
then nothing really went through your mind
are you so hard and so mean
but everything is over
you took her from me
what a friend yeah what a friend you were to me

That's why I helped you out of the gutter
was your friendship not so great
how often have you been there in my bed
you never saw your friend's wedding portrait on the wall

but everything is over
you took her from me
what a friend yeah what a friend you were to me <|endoftext|> 
The lights come on
it is quiet around me.
I wonder now
why am I alone now.
I made a mistake,
not to see friends.
That was my choice then
but I have seen it.

Once in my life,
it went wrong.
But I didn't hurt anyone anyway.
Once in my life, it went wrong
no I never wanted to be with you again.

No nobody understood
that I left you.
I didn't want your warmth anymore
no from any woman.
Yes I made the mistake
not to see friends.
But what was I supposed to do
maybe betray you.

Once in my life,
it went wrong.
But I didn't hurt anyone anyway.
Once in my life,
no I never wanted to be with you again.



Once in my life,
it went wrong.
But I didn't hurt anyone anyway.
Once in my life, it went wrong.
no I never wanted to be with you again.

Dreamland


Dreamland:

Wonderful land of my dreams. Somewhere far from here. Where I want to go so badly, where there can be no suffering.

Dreamland, Dreamland, oh I so long for dreamland.
There is always fear so come with me, together to the wonderful dreamland.





Wanderer you will find peace there, sick person you know no pain. There is no battle there where my brothers are still.

 together:
Dreamland, Dreamland, oh I so long for dreamland there is always a fear so come with me, together to the wonderful dreamland.


(Chorus)
There is always fear, so come with me to the wonderful dreamland. Dreamland, dreamland, oh I so long for dreamland. There is always fear so come with me, together to the wonderful dreamland. <|endoftext|> 
You wrote to me that you are coming to tell me what you want
Because someone else has taken my place
I sat too long for you, that's why you didn't stay true to me
But you forget how I got here

But if you're in front of me, don't agree
And don't cry, because you can't be serious
Do you want to do one more thing? When you come to me later
Then don't forget to bring my kids

What I haven't seen them for so long
But know that they never spare their father
And don't think they will say Daddy
To your friend who has to lose it there



What I've done with my kids before
He cannot stand in my shadow in that
I'm not mad that you took another one
But always let my kids come to me

But if you're in front of me, don't agree
And don't cry, because you can't be serious
Do you want to do one more thing? When you come to me later
Please take my children with you

Do you want to do one more thing? When you come to me later
Please take my children with you <|endoftext|> 
Your number was not in the phone book
The address you gave me was not real
When I ask you why, why are you lying to me
I didn't do that to you either
My door was always open for you
Protected you from the cold
You liked my bed, my blankets, I slept in my chair
Yet you stayed so cool with me

refr .:
    Why is it so dark around you
    Why is happiness no longer rewarded
    You have lived with me too short
    Now you're gone, left me alone



I asked you to talk to me so many times
But then you either stopped or disappeared
I had to let you go then
Without knowing where

refr. (2x) <|endoftext|> 
Last week I was in a disco
and I felt so alone there
It was hot and busy, I was sitting next to an empty stool
I so longed for you here by my side
yeah i still think how it was
when you sat next to me here at the bar
I asked you to join the drink, you thought that was okay
when you looked at me toasting I got so soft

Chorus:
A LITTLE BIT IN LOVE
I THOUGHT A LITTLE IN LOVE
IF I KNOW WHAT YOU THOUGHT THEN
I NEVER WAITED FOR YOU
AS A CHILD I DREAMED
THIS NIGHT YOU ARE FOR ME
BUT THAT DREAM passed quickly



you got up and said keep my seat free
I have to go away but I'll be right back
oh well that stool remained empty until I noticed
that you left without me, I was alone again

Chorus <|endoftext|> 
Boy I'm taking you to bed
We'll have fun together again tomorrow
Sleep but I will not go
It went wrong between Mommy and me

Now close your eyes and dream
Soon life will be beautiful for you
Dream but I'm by your side
My boy dreams of mommy and me

Daddy only has you
You are worth more to me than any woman



It is for you that I am still alive
Where I give my love to

Don't let your father stand later either
You are still unspoiled there
With your blond curly hair and your eyes closed
I am always there for you <|endoftext|> 
I warned you, it is getting dark around you
Wouldn't you change? But you're still made of stone
Now you are in your place, you earn money with sex
I can see it from a distance, if only I had called

refr .:
   Don't you think about your kids now?
    Don't you think about me anymore?
    I can't love you anymore
    You are so happy with a stickie
    I really don't want to talk to you anymore
    There is no more pardon for you
    And don't get to the kids
    Because they don't love you anymore

Everyone wanted to help you, but you, you laughed at them
But believe me, you will need them later
Because you have no, no red penny
Just keep standing in the rain, especially now don't catch a cold
Because with me the warmth is for the children but not for you



refr.

Got a picture of us together, yes you looked so mean there already
I should have known then, you belong to everyone

refr. <|endoftext|> 
It's sad to walk here in the rain
How many times have I walked this street with you
You were so young and so shy then
We talked about getting married sooner or later
You said to keep waiting for you
I did, but you did not stay true to me

refr .:
    Deep in my heart I knew you are too young for me
    Deep in my heart I knew: this will suddenly pass
    Deep in my heart a voice said, this is not for you
    She's too young, she doesn't know anything about loyalty yet
    When she leaves it will be too late



Now you are a woman who laughs at life
You make friends that I unconsciously hate anyway
I will never be able to forgive myself for this
It is now as if love does not exist
I hope you find happiness with that other person
It's my own fault, you can't do anything about this

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Do you mind?
Do we stay with you?
I haven't been with you for so long.
Would you like to talk to me for a second?
After what we did, I have earned it.
you really don't have to explain anything to me
but I was always your friend
well I know there is another
no that is no longer a concern for me
only that you don't deserve me

(CHORUS)

the world seemed so beautiful
the world between you and me
a world full of promise
a world just for you.
for me there was no longer any place in that world you live in
but I'm the one who survives it all.


a tear in your eyes but i'm gonna laChen forever.
have you already torn up my photos
well I can only hate you
you have to understand what I want that to happen




(REFRAIN 2x)

My son had his birthday yesterday, he turned eight years old my darling
He asked me a kite, and he had one too
To his ball, his bike, his trains, no he did not care about that
Because his kite was everything to him, but I didn't know why

And then one morning, he said, Father are you coming along;
The wind is now favorable, so I bring my kite
A kite in one hand, a letter in the other
I couldn't understand him, but then my son said sweet
I have a letter here for my mother
Which is high in heaven
I tie this letter to my kite
Until she receives him, she whom I miss
And when she reads how much I love her
That I can't get used to that other woman
I have a letter here for my mother
Which is high in heaven



I have a letter here for my mother
The one high, the one high in heaven
I tie this letter to my kite
Until she receives him, she, she whom I miss

I have a letter here for my mother
Which is high in heaven
I tie this letter to my kite
Until she receives him, she whom I miss
And when she reads how much I love her

You still don't understand what I'm saying
Why don't you ever join, go out
You also know that life doesn't last forever
Pick up the thread and don't back down

refr .:
   Because the sun will certainly shine for you too
   You will then see, you belong to this world
   Do you want to live like this, curtains closed every day
   You never get further than the front door of your house
   I know it's easy to talk but you have to get out
   If you don't notice that yourself, look ahead from now on
   Because the sun will certainly shine for you too
   You will then see, you belong to this world



Why you chose this, no I don't understand
Tell me why are you so sad
I know if you talk to me I can help you
You will say, I can take on the world again

refr.

What do I have to tell you now
If you already know everything
And you don't believe me
But you promised me
That you will talk to me
I can no longer defend myself
It is too late for that now
But you should know that
I never had another
And that I love
Here in front of me

refr .:
   I really can't cheat on you
   Or lie to you
   You should know that
   Why don't you even come and talk
   Before you start hating me
   Even if only for a moment
   I really want you to know the truth
   And forget all that nonsense quickly
   I really can't cheat on you
   Or lie to you
   You should know that



We were always together anyway
I was never alone anyway
therefore I do not understand
That you see someone else
And you don't trust me anymore
I can no longer defend myself
It is too late for that now
But you should know that
I never had another
And that I love
Here in front of me

Chorus

Why don't you even come and talk
Before you start hating me
Even if only for a moment
I really can't cheat on you
Or lie to you
You should know that
Why don't you come and talk first
Before you start hating me
Even if only for a moment
Ooooooohhhh <|endoftext|> 
When night falls I start to live
During the day I am timid and cool
Yes, because I want to experience everything at night
Then I dare to say what I feel

During the day my hands are shaking
And then I'm not sure of myself
How I would have loved to give love
Now I have to buy it but I want that myself

I was so often fooled
I often gardened in it again
Yes the night is my life
I buy the happiness
What else can I do then
I then walk on the street
Filled, yes my pockets full of money
Let me live like this
I'll stay alone
Let me do my thing now
So I am happy
Now let me stand alone in the world



Once I thought now I know for sure
I've now met the woman forever
But she ran off with someone else
I was sick for months and I was sorry
I was often laughed at at work
That's why I love the night so much
I have nothing to do with those screamers
I will never really complain, not a single complaint

I was so often fooled
I often gardened in it again
Yes the night is my life
I buy the happiness
What else can I do then
I then walk on the street
Filled, yes my pockets full of money
Let me live like this
I'll stay alone
Let me do my thing now
So I am happy
Now let me stand alone in the world <|endoftext|> 
The castellan pours some more and then checks his clock.
It's time.
Everyone quickly empties their glass,
the latter is tapped.
A jukebox that suddenly stopped.
It is high time people shouted from the corner.
The coupons are ready.
Ah may I pop tonight, a man's voice asks.
You pay tomorrow.

It's time,
high time.
You will be thanked for another evening of fun.
Goodbye madam and goodbye sir, you will come here again ?? !!

The bell is sounded, the last one is mine.
Then we'll go home quickly.
Well for from the very last,
who thinks of me.
I also have a home.
At the table in the corner, there is a man sitting alone.

And stares straight ahead.
Soon he will soon be forgotten again,
he thinks where can I go.
I have no red penny.

It is time, high time.
You will be thanked for another evening of fun.
Goodbye madam and goodbye sir, you will come here again ?? !!

The waiter shouts come on, folks, it's about time
Because I have a family.
Because she knows what time we close, I'll be home late.

I can't go in anymore.
Another joke and a little laugh then it's over
The case that is now empty.
Empty bottles and some peanuts are on the floor.
The jukebox that suddenly stopped.



It is time, high time.
You will be thanked for another evening of fun.
Goodbye madam and goodbye sir, you will come here again?

It is time, high time.
You will be thanked for another evening of fun.
Goodbye mrs hahahahaha and goodbye sir. You come here again?

COME ON WITH ALL OF IT !!

You sat in the sun
I first saw you from my balcony
I asked you: Is this place available?
You didn't answer, you did smile at me

It was the holiday of this century
I was warm despite a thick layer of snow

In the evening by the fireplace
we drank a delicious glass of warm wine
I really fell in love with you
How many times did I say I love you?



refr .:
    It was just partying
    It was just drinking
    Life then stood still for us for a moment
    Well, these were good weeks
    Which actually seemed like years
    I'd like to see you again, that's what I want

It was the holiday of this century
I was warm despite a thick layer of snow

refr.

That is what I want <|endoftext|> 
Late at night, when night falls on the city
Yes, then I get an urge, I have to go again
Every pub is an open door for me
This night is really not over yet
I am here to forget everything
Because I miss you, you should know that

refr .:
    But tonight I am the king of the square
    Hand it out, yes, I'll give them beer and red wine
    Then I have plenty of friends
    It smells like sandwiches and sweat
    Long live the fun, long live the beer and the fun
    But tonight we have a full moon
    And I don't know where my bed will be tonight
    I have no worries, I let them believe that
    I feel like the king of the square, let me go



During the day, I am so alone
Well, what am I supposed to do, I have nowhere to go
I have no friends, no luck, that hurts me
No, it's no fun being alone then
It's so difficult, if only you had stayed here
Well, it's over, you don't want to live with me anymore

refr.

Then I have plenty of friends
It smells like sandwiches and sweat

I feel like the king of the square, let me go <|endoftext|> 
I couldn't hear you
but I read in your eyes
that you needed someone
you felt alone
there was such a big difference between us
your language and your habits
but something always stayed with me
your love, your love
even if I don't speak your language
I had understood one word correctly

amor, amor, amor
amor, amor, amor
what have you done to me
my heart, I felt it open
amor, amor, amor
amor, amor, amor
I don't need to understand any more
no, I'll never let you go, amore



I still smoke a cigarette
and watch you sleep
everything is so strange to me
I lived here alone for too long
now i know what i missed
that love can be so beautiful
the happiness I have now received
it's like sunshine
i hope you will stay here
being alone can be dispel

ref <|endoftext|> 
When you're with me everything is so different
When you're with me everything will be fine
If you're with me, you may know
That my heart will beat faster for you
When you're there, nobody can disturb us
The two of us, no one around us

When you're with me everything is so different
When you are with me I feel so good

refr .:
   Life is beautiful, you have to be able to share it
   Because it has been so short, enjoy it now
   You stand still and life can give you nothing anymore
   Search because happiness is there for you



When you're with me, those are those hours
I lock the door and close the curtain
If you're with me, it can take a long time
Lie on the floor with a nice glass of wine
When you're there, nobody can disturb us
No, the two of us, no one around us

When you're with me everything is so different
When you are with me I feel so good

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Is there nobody there
who wants to write to me?
Is there nobody there
isn't it so quiet here?
Where are my friends
with whom I have shared everything?
Where are the women
who caressed me?

There is nobody there
who thinks of me for a moment?
Is there nobody there
who gives me his friendship?
Even with my birthday
you left me alone.
When I get out later
where can I still go?

I've been sitting here for so long
a bare cell in the prison.
Will this stay my life?
How long should this go on?
I've been sitting here for so long
a stone wall is my wallpaper.
And no curtains,
but bars in my window.



Here you will notice,
that your mother is no longer alive
And that your father,
no longer cares about you.
I'm going to air later
in a large steel cage.
How long will this take?
How beautiful life is outside.

I've been sitting here for so long
a bare cell in the prison.
Will this stay my life?
How long should this go on?
I've been sitting here for so long
a stone wall is my wallpaper.

How far did you think you could go
Why don't you want to talk to me
You live fine, you don't see me anymore
Tell me what have I done

You were so sweet in the beginning
Said nice words about love a family
That's over, you went your own way
We lived together too long

Ref: 2x
When I close the door behind me
Are you alone then it is over
Just let me go, then it's over
This is your chance
You are free again



My mistake was letting you go
For too long I have left you on a pedestal
You go ahead and live the way you want
I've wasted my time on you

Ref: 3x
When I close the door behind me
Are you alone then it is over

I know you are for hire
For a small amount per hour
I'd like to hire you for life
They come there with you
For some attention from a woman
But I am far too proud to give money

The night changes everyone
But during the day yes then you sit there alone

I see the red light
The curtains are closed for me
I know you're lying there on your bed
With those guys around you
I feel I have to walk
Because I don't want to buy you
Still, I will wait a little longer
On a glimpse of your face



I see them standing there horny
Every night in front of your window
They come out laughing
They're drooling like an animal
Why do I care about you
Why am I out in the cold
you should know that i'm crying
If they have been with you

The night changes everyone
But during the day yes then you sit there alone
I see the red light
The curtains are closed for me

I took you to the train and watched you
You wanted a holiday, so I said "Go"
I thought: Two weeks will be over in no time
I had the empire to myself
Little did I know that I would miss you so soon
I press your pillow against me hard
My feet stay cold, I'm already talking to myself
About you



I always arrive late at work
I miss your morning coffee
I put food out of the wall every day
To the pub every night
I acted very tough and said: Well, I'll be fine
You go away now and don't think about me
If only you were here again, it is so quiet in the house
Come back to me

When you called me I said cheerfully
"I'm so busy, I haven't thought of you yet"
I would have loved to cry then, dear
I'm so tired of that loneliness
Suddenly you are standing in front of me again, taking my hands
And tells me you missed me so much
I lied that I had a great time here
So, without you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you <|endoftext|>

For years you were my gabber
like a brother i loved you
I'll still see you there on the sidewalk
you were shivering from the cold
Without a house and without money
you even lost your wife
I said come and live here for so long
but I regret that now

That's why I helped you out of the gutter
was your friendship not so great
How many times have you been there in my bed
You never saw your boyfriend's wedding portrait on the wall
then nothing really went through you,
are you so hard and so mean
But everything is over, you took her away from me
it's a shame, our friendship is over

I never asked you a nickel
that you ate was normal
even if you wanted to go out once
I gave you some of my wages
I gave you everything, even my clothes
because a friend will not let you down
have you forgotten everything
why did you do this to me



That's why I helped you out of the gutter

how often have you been there in my bed

The castle line pours some more,
and then looks at his clock.
It's time.
Everyone quickly empties their glass,
the latter is tapped.
A jukebox that suddenly stopped.

It's about time
shouts are coming from a corner.
The receipts are ready.
Ah may I pop tonight,
ask a male voice.
You pay tomorrow.

It is time, high time.
You will be thanked for another evening of fun.
Goodbye madam and goodbye sir,
you will come here again.

The bell is being called
the last one is mine.
Then we'll go home quickly.
Well come on, the very last,
who thinks of me
I have a home too

At the table in the corner
there is a man sitting alone.
And stares straight ahead.
Soon he will soon be forgotten again,
he thinks where can I go.
I have no red penny.

It is time, high time.
You will be thanked for another evening of fun.
Goodbye ma'am, and goodbye sir,
you will come here again.
The waiter shouts: Come on folks,
It's high time.
I also have a family.
'Cause she knows what time we close
I come home late.
I can't go in anymore.



Another joke and a laugh,
then it's over
The case that is now empty.
Empty bottles and some peanuts,
lying on the ground.
The jukebox that suddenly stopped.

It is time, high time.
You will be thanked for another evening of fun.
Goodbye madam and goodbye sir,
you will come here again.

It is time, high time.
You will be thanked for another evening of fun.
Goodbye madam and goodbye sir,

Live, live your life the way you want
But leave me alone if it doesn't work out
Yes, I did but you didn't give anything back
No, I quit because you live a little too fast for me
Well, I'm not listening anymore
It's the same over and over again
Just go away I accept it

refr .:
    All your words are too many
    I healed what you broke
    But that is no longer necessary
    It's really the last time now
    Because you hated me more and more
    Really you are redundant here
    Because of you I lost my friends
    So it is high time
    That you go far from me
    You thought this couldn't happen
    When you saw me and conquered
    But my eyes opened

Cold, yes the world is cold around you
Hard and numb as a stone
I did not feel at home in that world
I missed so much warmth in my house
You don't even shed a tear now
While I just let you go
No, I don't choose such a cold existence



refr.

Lailalala etc.

Because of you I lost my friends

Make something of your life
don't put your head in the sand
lucky yourself, you know that
also a bit in hand
so don't sit around
if it ever goes against the grain
and think what's black today
might be white tomorrow

Now forget your worries
you live and you are free
so don't let your head hang
and smile yourself happily
ow because laughing makes you so happy

there is so much trouble
just look around you
many people are hungry
are sick old or alone
roll up your sleeves
and go against it
there is also your world
so don't stay outside



Now forget your worries
you live and you are free
so don't let your head hang
and smile yourself happily
ow because laughing makes you so happy

so don't wait around
about what the future does
and go with your eyes open
towards life

Now forget your worries
you live and you are free
so don't let your head hang

There you were, it seemed only for a moment.
The sweetest for one night
an opportunity that smiles at you.
Wrong thought, it stayed.
It didn't stop at that one time
you have no defense against love.
I asked you: will you stay with me.
Being alone is over forever.

1st chorus:
'Cause we're friends for life
comrades until the last day.
Friends for life,
if possible, if successful, if allowed.
Sometimes there is disagreement,
But that just takes a while.
Despite everything, we are friends for life.



When we met here,
you became my great ideal,
you totally controlled my existence.
No longer free, but together.
We whimpered through the deepest valley,
after every step a new fall.
And then stand up again
to go on with the two of you

2nd chorus:
'Cause we're friends for life
comrades until the last day.
Friends for life,
if possible, if successful, if allowed.
Together for a long time
committed loneliness
Despite everything, we are friends for life.

Friends for life,
I look for the warmth in you too.
Friends for life,
you lift my mood again.
Sometimes there is disagreement,
but that just takes a while.
Despite everything, we are friends for life. <|endoftext|> 
The night was always my friend
I had made my own money from a young age
Did not shy away from anything or anyone
Spoke the slang honestly and sincerely
And pushed my limits
With friends and women
Sometimes I went crazy and then I could no longer be stopped

I was scum off the ledge
Smoking, drinking, fighting, stealing
I really didn't care anymore
Scum
Then luck passed,
Love embraced me
This boy from the street
Became wise through shame and harm,
Because you are worth everything to me.

I was always in the pub
From late at night to early in the morning,
Yet you remained faithful to me,
Early on over and over '' please change now ''
Oh what have I hurt you
And pain,
But now I'll always be there for you.



I was scum off the ledge
Smoking, drinking, fighting, stealing
I really didn't care anymore

Get all fucked up anyway
All of you fall dead for my part
I don't feel like learning well
I'll end up in the gutter anyway
Children don't want to play with me
Call me "Rat," and point after me
The only one who cares
There never is, that's my dad

My mother can't bear me
I never do anything right for her
I don't have to ask for love either
Swearing is all she does
No wonder my dad went sailing
I was not allowed, I am too small
I have to do it on my own
Until he will be back someday

CHORUS:
If only I had someone to love
Two soft arms around me
Who would always protect me
I feel so damned alone!



Maybe when Father's ship arrives
When he's back from the sea
He says again: Listen Cis
Why don't you come with me?
I'm just a kid after all
Can't do it all alone
Maybe someday I will find happiness
But how..? that's a big problem


If only I had someone to love
Two soft arms around me
Who would always protect me
I feel so damned alone!

Who would always protect me from the forest
I feel so damned alone! <|endoftext|> 
't Was on the Costa del Sol (tingelingeling)
There my heart was racing (tingling)
He spoke to me of amore
I was totally lost

He played his guitar
And gently stroked my hair tingling
I will never forget him
Him and the Costa del Sol

Chorus:
It was so nice (tingeling, tingeling)
by moonlight (tingeling, tingeling)
and Spanish wine (tingeling, tingeling)
to be together .....

I'm back in my country (tingling)
Rain and dark sky (tingeling)
Still, I keep dreaming
What happened to me

I still hear his guitar (tingling)
and feel his hand through my hair

I will never forget him
him and the Costa del Sol

It was so nice (tingeling, tingeling)
by moonlight (tingeling, tingeling)

Every morning at the stroke of eight, little Jan stepped to the water
And there he was met with a friendly chatter
Seven swans are faithfully waiting for their boyfriend to come
Little Janneman of eight, who always brought them crusts

Seven white swans, spotless and clean
Waiting every morning for their boyfriend so little
Seven white swans in the back of a ditch
Got bread from their boyfriend every morning

One morning he came back with his well-stocked basket
But they were no longer there, until his horror saw little Jantje
They floated in a row there in a heavy slush of oil
A tear falls from his eyes, why did they do that.



Seven white swans, spotless and clean
Can no longer be Janje's friends anymore
Seven white swans, swans proud and big
Cruel found the end in that dirty ditch

Lalalala laaa laaaa lalalala laaaaa
lalalala laaaa laaaa lalalaaa lala laaaaa

Seven white swans, swans proud and big
Cruel found the end in that dirty ditch
Found the end cruel not that dirty ditch <|endoftext|> 
I came to Mexico
The land of love and sun
It was in the shade of the trees
that just like in dreams
a fairy tale began.

i was there on a big fiesta
I saw a cabbalero standing there
we danced a rumba together
And there with that rumba
everything came into being

Guitar music echoed through the Mexican night
Guitar music has brought love to us

I will always live there
Please give other countries as a present
Yes it continues to appeal to me
because I have lost my heart
in beautiful Mexico

Mexico, Mexico

oh land of all my dreams
With the guitar music you brought the romance
for him and me

Mexico, Mexi-iiiico

I will always live there
you are worth everything to me
a paradise on earth
Yes that is you

They float like wreckage
On a quiet ocean
The current and the wind alone
Determine where they go
They don't fight against anything and
They don't want to be anyone
I see them, they are waiting
On the last train

Once they were once the ships
Overloaded with silver
Overcome the storms
On the return trip to the port
Until she hit the rocks of love
Be smashed
Now they kill time and wait
On the last train



The one who will deliver them
Not far from here
It's a black prince of iron
With a heart as cold as steel
They will hug him
And when the light disappears
Have they been taken
By the last train

I don't know their past
But I do know the feeling
Moving the empty
Without thinking, without purpose
Maybe I got lucky
Maybe I also had less pain
I just know the thought
On the last train

I watch the time go by
On a blown-out platform
It is now nearly midnight
And quiet in the station
I leave them behind
The dead who are still alive
I can hear them in the distance
Here comes the last train <|endoftext|> 
refr .:
    I don't love you for your beautiful hair
    Not for your rare pair of blue eyes
    Not because of your pretty white hands
    Not because of your pearly white teeth
    I don't love you for your beautiful figure
    Not because of that beautiful gift of nature
    I didn't marry you for all that beauty
    Love you for your heart of gold



When I look at other women
Well then I was the best
And I often say to myself
Yes young dear, you should be lucky
It's not because you're a beauty
Because you get used to beauty
But I love you because now I got to know your beautiful character

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Oh beautiful old tower
You stand there for years now
Wherever I walk in the Jordaan
You follow me everywhere
If you would tell
What you see like this all these years
What a lot you could tell us
But old man, you just don't

refr .:
    O beautiful Westertoren
    High in that blue sky
    I blame my singing on you
    My laugh, my last breath
    You know our deepest secrets
    Our sorrow, our sorrow and more
    You just play your chimes
    And looks down on us in silence



Oh big proud Wester
I am filled with reverence
When the golden sunlight
Your slender striker envelops
When my last hour strikes
The forces slowly fly away from me
Then I want a window in my attic
Allowing me to see your tower

refr. <|endoftext|> 
O tall, stiff tower
You have been there for years
Wherever I walk along a canal or street
You follow me everywhere
If you were going to tell
What you see like this all these years
What a lot you could tell us
But you don't do it

refr .:
    Oh beautiful old tower
    High in the blue sky
    I dedicate my songs to you
    My singing my laugh my sigh
    You know our deepest secrets
    Our sorrow suffered and more
    You only play your chimes
    And looks down on us in silence

O gray old tower
How sweet I look at you
When the porder comes early in the morning
And I have to get to work
How nice do your bells sound
How bright you show, how warm
When I'm walking with my love
So blissfully arm in arm



refr.

O tall proud tower
I am filled with reverence
When the golden sunlight
Your slender striker envelops
When my last hour strikes
The forces slowly escape me
Then I want a window on my sofa
Through which I can see your tower

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Girl, without you I'm lost
And I feel bad because I lost you
However, I was born for you
I'm so alone, I'm so sorry

Where do I go now
Without you
Where do I go now
You let me down

You were the woman I trusted
Who cheated on me with my best friend
You will never be able to love him
Have I really not earned anymore



There is no point
Without you
I have to tell you
That I still love you

...

This makes no sense
Without you
Do I have to show you
That I still love you <|endoftext|> 
When she dances my heart beats in my throat
when she smiles she doesn't let anything of me whole
and she looks, she sees right through me,
I'm not alone anymore
Because at night she stays with me and sleeps in my house
my bed becomes our ship, the morning a dot.
At night she stays with me and whispers my name,
I whisper her name.
How much is too much?
How far is too far?
How long will she stay with me?
How much is too much?
How far is too far?
The rain is crying for sun in her head
God she knows what she wants and why
And I dream she dreams of the two of us
she walks with me
How much is too much
How far is too far?
How long will she stay with me?
How much is too much?
How far is too far?
How long will she stay with me?
How she talks, how she eats, how she drinks
How she knows her voice sounds inside me
When my turmoil twists my words
she knows what she sows.
Because at night she stays with me and sleeps in my house
My bed becomes our ship, the morning a dot
At night she stays with me and whispers my name
I whisper her name. <|endoftext|> 
She's stealing my soul, she's stealing my clothes
She steals my lenses and my stationery
And even the laces on my shoes
Its not a second safe here

And I'm slowly losing my head
Because she had promised me something completely different
And I have believed every word too
And showing off for her beautiful eyes

I walk the rubber off my soles
While she sleeps in black satin
I'm freezing to death outside
If she happens to want to be alone for once



And I lose ...

I always made up my mind
To grow up for gallows and rad
Now I get rich and respect table
I've only had bad luck with her

And I lose ... <|endoftext|> 
That it stops after so many years
Fills you with regret
But it is unfortunately reality:
We are no longer who we used to be
You lost me

It's getting icy cold in your heart
Because the one you love
Became a different man
Yes, I am changing the plan
And so we don't grow old together

Don't look so surprised
Overwhelmed
Time for yourself now
Everything in life
Has a reason
Time for myself now

I know it's a common story
It would never happen to us
We were special
But time has overtaken everything
And ends our dreams
The price has been paid

And my heart is totally upset
Because I know how I looked at you
It was exciting and clean
But it got boring and ordinary
And we abandoned each other



Don't look so surprised
Overwhelmed
Time for yourself now
Everything in life
Has a reason
It's time for myself now

I don't want you to beg
Love has faded
That's a fact
We cannot ignore it
We must move on
Love overboard for both of us

Don't look so surprised
Overwhelmed
Time for yourself now
Everything in life
Has a reason
It's time for myself now

Everything in life
Has a reason
It's time for myself now

You say, "It's a waste of time"
That it stops after many years
Fills you with regret <|endoftext|> 
Weeks of tears.
Silences at breakfast.
Your eyes for doubt and full of regret.
The weapons are down.
The words flow collapses.
No regrets for what was there and not for what is to come!

I'm letting you go now my dear.
The time is right for this decision.
Now take a different path and now look ahead.
I let you go my darling.
It doesn't work anymore so feel free.
Now live without me!
.
I see you out the door.
You look back for a moment.
Your smile shines through your last tear.
We have to get through here now.
Now eat away the pain.
How hopeless this may seem, it will soon be different.

I'm letting you go now my dear.
The time is right for this decision.
Now take a different path and now look ahead.
I let you go my darling.
It doesn't work anymore so feel free.
Now live without me.



It was a great time.
And I keep the photos.
But it is a complete past.
Enough has been fought.

I'm letting you go now my dear.
The time is right for this decision.
Now take a different path and now look ahead.
I let you go my darling.
It doesn't work anymore so feel free.
Now live without me!

Now live without me! <|endoftext|> 
It's so blessed to wake up next to you
And so nice to be able to make you happy
It seems like you were born for me
And I feel as good as never before
It's true
It's so good to be with you

Tell me what you felt, what went through you
You said all this seems like a dream to me
If you still have doubts, you are sometimes still distraught
Because every morning you bloom like a rose



It's so blissful ...

You shouldn't even be blind sometimes, let yourself be guided by a voice
Maybe he knows what to do next
Because she tells me: hold on this time, throw your anchor in the sea
The beginning was good and there is so much more to come

It's so blissful ... <|endoftext|> 
You count the hours.
All sunlight on the walls becomes one with the ground.
You let it hang cause you feel trapped here
but the road is round again.
Another hour,
and the weekend is already calling out loud.
Fire, kindle many fires.
It must come out!
You feel like moving.
Which style is irrelevant.
Though you wanna dance in the rain
nothing or no one is holding you down now.
Under control.
Because you feel that urge.
For so long.
There are laws, regulations,
but you are still free in your head.
They often want to convince you of opinions
in which you don't believe.
There is hope,
our salvation is near.
Hear.
How the rhythm dispels worries.
You feel like moving
which style does not matter.
Though you wanna dance in the rain
nothing or no one is holding you down now.
Under control.
Because you feel that urge.
For so long.

You feel like moving
which style does not matter.
Though you wanna dance in the rain
nothing or no one is holding you down now.
Under control.

For so long.
Yeah!
You want to move!
Want to move!
Yeah! <|endoftext|> 
She can comfort me
like no one can
She makes me hope again
when i'm small and scared

She knows the words
she sees the moment
She can comfort me
when no one knows me



Time stops here
when she hugs me tenderly
no questions, no reproaches
only her love that warms me

I have nothing to fear
Nothing is ever too much for her
She can heal me
She makes me whole again
Because she knows the words
she sees the moment
She can comfort me
when no one knows me <|endoftext|> 
I've never known such a lovely girl
When I am with you I am always spoiled
But if there is a place where you are fierce
Surely it is in your apartment

You walk upstairs and you lead me with you
You let me peek into your deep neckline
I can't wait anymore, I want a lot more
your beautiful body is so wild

You drive me crazy, so crazy ...

The other girls are too tame for me
I'm on fire just for you
You are the first to not keep a secret from me
You're the very first to get me this far



You show your room and you show it to me very thoroughly
I am perplexed, I am not of age
So uninhibited, so sensual
No effort is too much for me now

You drive me crazy, so crazy ...

Sweat runs down your cheek
We are next to each other
Oh no that won't take long
You stroke my hair again
Still untamed, you want even more
Your beautiful body is going wild again

You drive me crazy, so crazy ... <|endoftext|> 
I saw her standing there, she had those beautiful eyes
She looked at me and she smiled, she went with me
But then you came, and she was under a spell
It must be over, there is no room for the two of us here

Because she's mine
You think she's yours
But she's mine
Z-Z-Z-She's mine
You think she's yours but
damn, damn, damn it
She's mine

Yesterday she said: you are my little boy
Oh, but apparently I'm not alone
Who hears that from her
What more do you have, I would like to know
Because her game with you continues



she's mine
you think she's yours but she's mine
Z-Z-Z-She's mine
you think she's yours but
damn, damn, damn
she's mine

She smiles at you, winks at me
She drives us crazy, both you and me
Me and you

I toss and turn in my sleep
She puts both of us for a monkey and yet
still...
You have nothing to do with her

because she is mine
you think she's yours but she's mine
Z-Z-Z-She's mine
you think she's yours but
damn, damn, damn
she's mine <|endoftext|> 
Excuse me for interrupting briefly
But my pulse is racing a bit.
Excuse me I'm slightly upset
What I need is a lot of rock and roll.

Take a break, don't philosophize, have fun,
Until morning.
Excuse me for forgetting for a moment
what i do but i just want now

Sing and don't whine.
The whole night.
Let it happen here and now.
Unexpected.

Excuse me this ain't normal anymore
but I have never been real normally.
Excuse me this really is a scandal
Later I am ashamed but first I celebrate.



Take a break, don't philosophize, have fun,

Excuse me, this is about real
This week or this year

Sing and don't whine.

Unexpected.

So much misery
So little feeling
Let me be weird with this gang
They know what I mean

Leave me
Sing and don't whine.

Let it happen here and now.
Never thought.

Sing and don't whine.
The whole night.
Let it happen here and now.
Unexpected. <|endoftext|> 
Early in the morning, while I'm still asleep
then you will wait for me too
the sun rises,
you've already turned off the alarm and
you sneak into bed next to me and
says my name until I wake up
Your happy voice is no longer whispering
you walk to sing and you tell
your dreams again
and all the plans you've made up
because our day has long begun
and so we are, never alone again.
so beautiful yes you are so beautiful
the way you watch and dance, the sun rises
your face.
and even though you are so small
I want to be everything to you
yes so beautiful yes so are you
You kiss my mouth, kiss me very softly
with one eye open I see you
smiles at me
because you like me like no other
knows and you are the sweetest
I love you and my heart sings
so beautiful yes you are so beautiful
the way you watch and dance, the sun rises
your face.
and even though you are so small
I want to be everything to you
yes so beautiful yes so are you
so beautiful <|endoftext|> 
Soul, now that I get to your bottom
And I search again and again
Soul, now that I am open to you
I find myself again and again

Been blind for way too long
For what lives in the depths
But I know better I trust you

I'd rather see you now
Intuitive, purely on feeling
No, I have nothing left to lose
With all my soul is good enough

Sweet, I want to be with you so badly
Stretch out your arms and touch me
Your soul, share it and trust me
Everything is new, but let yourself go



Been scared for too long
For what your soul has to give
But now I know better and trust you

I'd rather see you now
Intuitive, purely on feeling
No, I have nothing left to lose
With all my soul is good enough

Your eyes are the mirror of our soul

I'd rather see you now
Intuitive, purely on feeling
No, I have nothing left to lose
With all my soul is good enough <|endoftext|> 
She looks like a statue
Carved of stone,
A real cool chick
But it's a killer
Already has an awful lot of names on her deadlist
And if you really want to try with her
Go ahead
Because don't forget, beautiful songs don't last long
Come pay me a beer and get that kid out of your mind

Because she's after me and I'm terrified
That lady is constantly chasing me
Tell me the reason why she won't calm down
God my life is in danger



She devoured men with skin and hair
It's really not a piece of granite
Yes she's a killer
and you will be next on her deadlist
But if you really want to try with her
Go ahead
Because don't forget beautiful songs don't last long
Come pay me a drink and get that kid out of your mind <|endoftext|> 
In a shirt you don't recognize
Show off that photo from last year
Looks like the same guy
The same look in your eyes, the same hair
But everything feels everything
You whisper a new name
Not so sensible
But you're on a volcano
Love makes you sick again
The doctor says it will never go away
Always love again
You know it yourself: it is too late
You're scared on a park bench
Waiting for a sign of life
Every sigh lasts a lifetime
You can't breathe
Moving is difficult for you
Because everything feels different
You whisper her name again
Not so sensible
but you're on a volcano
You are sick of love
Sometimes you want to flee but your shoes are too heavy
You know the rumors: you will remain addicted to her <|endoftext|> 
I run and I walk, pass myself again, make way too little time to be with you.
I know you are dreaming of a new day, of spring in your smile.
Summer in your heart.

Dare to believe that there is a lifeline that leads straight to your dream.
You don't have to be afraid, it will be a wonderful, wonderful journey and I will be with you on that wonderful, wonderful journey.

You are not alone, look around you, that great sea of ​​people, it travels with you.
Yes I care about you, hmm, I love you and I want to be with you.
Travel with us.

You have to believe there is a lifeline leading straight to your dream.
You don't have to be afraid, it will be a wonderful, wonderful journey and I will be with you on that wonderful, wonderful journey.



You have to believe, I find your lifeline leading straight to your dream.
You don't have to be afraid, it will be a wonderful, wonderful journey and I will be with you on that wonderful, wonderful journey.

You don't have to be afraid, it will be a wonderful, wonderful journey and I will be with you on that wonderful, wonderful journey.

A wonderful journey.
A wonderful journey.
A wonderful journey. <|endoftext|> 
The alarm goes on much too early
there's no point getting up now,
and I look, sideways, unbelievable.
I see you naked with your eyes closed so perfectly in the morning light,
and I, again, am blown away from the fact that I am not dreaming this
you never get used to something like that.

What a life with you by my side.
It is wonderful now that you look at me, I know you say without a word that I belong to you.

you there you there people make dreams come true ..
you there you there make people dream ...

Any man who loves women will stare after you
is blinded by you, magic.
I see they fantasize
and if you hug me passionately, they are gone and I am spoiled, because of your husband.
Let them learn that they better be elsewhere.
You're only there for me.

What a life with you by my side.
It's lovely now that you're looking at me, I know you're without a word
makes me believe in the truth.
Let me understand this is forever.



you there, you there


And now I know you say without a word that I belong to you.
you there you there people make dreams come true ..
you there you there people make dreams come true ..

You make people's dreams come true.
This is the life and you are the woman, unbelievably upside down.
Ooh, this is the life you are the woman to believe, what a life. <|endoftext|> 
What are you thinking of
When you look at me
Let yourself go
take your time
Do you have a wish
Do you have a dream
I know no limit
I'm just trying

What will I do for you
What will I be to you
Let me know something
Give me a call
And I'll be there

Whatever you come up with
Whatever you ask
Nothing is too bad for me
I do what pleases you



What shall I ...

Will I be a prince you've been dreaming of for a long time
Or will I just be a friend who lives in your heart?

What shall I ... <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes I think back to those summer days
With my old buddies
hang in the streets
Sometimes I see back heo we got together
Crazy jokes
Walking all night long
Always
Together
They were crazy years
But where have those wild hairs gone now?
There was nothing that could hurt us
Because the night and the world belonged to us
To my buddies and to me
Former is over
Sometimes I think back to strong stories
Drunk on too much
And still show it off
Tent on the beach, no ball to pay
A taste of life
Pass on joint
We continued
That's what Friends Are For
They were crazy years
We were tireless
And went after all the women
But what it really came down to:
We always chose each other
Crazy years <|endoftext|> 
For a moment I didn't seem to be alive
Distraught and exhausted for no reason
It hung in my clothes for weeks
Until my world was suddenly adjusted

My dream is becoming more than ever
Inhabited by you

You give me sparks and fire
Dangerous but long-lived
And you give me longing and loyalty
Because being with you is the kick that really wanted

Wonderful to see you move
I'm gonna float when I look into your eyes
Racing on slippery roads
Giving everything without giving way once

Because you're clearing every job for me anyway



You give me sparks and fire
Dangerous but long-lived
And you give me longing and loyalty
Because being with you is the kick I really wanted

This is heavenly, so unworldly, delicious
And magical every time
And what's weird: it happens automatically
And seven out of seven!

For a moment I didn't seem to be alive
But now I live better than ever

You give me sparks and fire
Dangerous but long-lived
And you give me longing and loyalty
Because being with you is the kick I really wanted

Like a dive in the dark shallow water
The kick I really wanted
Like a hard drug but without it
Addiction and hangover
The kick I really wanted <|endoftext|> 
I thought this only existed in movies
What a great feeling
Eternal happiness on the horizon
Inundated with passion

But then suddenly that cold feet
And I did not dare

What have I done?
I miss you
The doubt is over
What have I done
I want you
Forever here with me
What have I done?

Maybe I thought too much
That was my big mistake
Because I followed my head and not my heart
Who now leaves the woman he loves?



Only now do I realize it was nonsense
To let go of that dream

What have I done?
I miss you
The doubt is over
What have I done
I want you
Always here with me
What have I done?

Now I feel ready
I jump in my car and drive
I arrive at you
I call with trembling knees
You open the door
I see you smile and I say

What have I done?
I miss you
The doubt is over
What have I done
I want you
Forever here with me
What have I done? <|endoftext|> 
I've never looked back
Although I sometimes feel a little nostalgia
When I see my own children playing
Then I see myself walking again
Eight years old and full of energy
And in my world what I am an astronaut and racing driver
Striker who would score every match

Freer than the wind, out of chains, through the ribbon
A comet in the universe
Freer than the wind, a new beginning every day
Nobody knows what will come
I can't believe it was possible
I can't believe it was possible
Freer than the wind
Like a superman in free fall

We had nothing to fear
Because that's what you have friends for
Do bell pull with the pastor's maid
Always chafed knees
Broken bike and mud pants
And if you broke a window, you flew into the corner with loud curses
But we didn't care anyway



Freer than the wind, out of chains, through the ribbon
A comet in the universe
Freer than the wind, a new beginning every day
Nobody knows what will come
I can't believe it was possible
I can't believe it was possible
Freer than the wind
Like a superman

Not that I'm different now
But it will never be like it was then
Yet I still often hear that voice
That tells me to close my eyes
To do something rash and foolish

Freer than the wind, out of chains, through the ribbon
A comet in the universe
Freer than the wind, a new beginning every day
Nobody knows what will come
I can't believe it was possible
I can't believe it was possible
Freer than the wind
Like a superman in free fall <|endoftext|> 
The blue night is soft
the bluest night
The courage of despair drives me forward
the light colors the streets red
the moon yawns in the gutter
Dawn is so far away
I slide with the flow
The smoke dances around my head
And the mist is slowly closing in on me
The wind is blowing in my back
I stroll and I sigh
And carve your name on a tree over and over
Turn off the lights
mute the sound
numb my senses
crooked never gets straight again
no this fight
I can't win
I approach full of expectation
I still have so much to leave
so many devils to defeat
and I miss you
And I know you say
what must be said is said
but I stumble, fall and fight
and I miss you
You say "past tense"
but I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose your love
The orchestra plays out of time
their tango comes too late
I drink but feel my heart freeze
Even a thousand miles from home
sounds the noise
Past completed
'The price has long been paid
the beer stale
far from Eden
I arrive with open hands
I still have so much to leave
so many devils to defeat
and I miss you
and I know you say
that the matter has already been settled
but I stumble, fall and fight
because I miss you
I arrive expectantly
I still have so much to leave
so many devils to defeat
and I miss you
and I know you say
that the matter has already been settled
and I stumble and fall and fight
and I miss you
Rain in my heart
confused forever
perfect past
Morning is near
for you and me
far away from Eden <|endoftext|> 
I stammer through my sentences
I stopped every word
Is because of you
Don't know how to start
Forgetting how it should be
Because of you

I breathe in and count to 3
But shake, tremble, no
Why can't I?

CHORUS:
I seem crazy
oooh
Bird for the cat
But it's perfect
Owl
As long as you smile at me
You just take me out of my comfort zone
I am upside down
Just ridiculous
I seem crazy

My glass falls from my hands
A stupid question comes out of my mouth
I'm trying to pull myself together
But all my guts fell to the floor
Once it went smoothly, 1000 times
But here with you
Am I nowhere anymore

CHORUS:
I seem crazy
oooh
Bird for the cat
But it's perfect
Owl
As long as you smile at me
You just take me out of my comfort zone
I am upside down
Just ridiculous



I bumble, tumble down
I'm too cowardly
I am too loud
Shame goes to my head
As soon as you look I am numb
This is an unknown man
It eats completely from your hand
I look nothing like that guy anymore
who I was yesterday

CHORUS:
I seem crazy
oooh
Bird for the cat
But it's perfect
Owl
As long as you smile at me
You just take me out of my comfort zone
I am upside down
Just ridiculous


I seem crazy
oooh
Bird for the cat

As long as you smile at me

I am upside down
Just ridiculous
I seem crazy <|endoftext|> 
I look at the sky and see you go
The plane disappears in silver clouds
To your new home

And you told me, in my heart I stay close to you
But a scared feeling sticks to me
Now that you traverse the heavens with him

You're from here and he's from there
You always wanted to travel the world
Don't shed a tear

And enjoy
There must be a lot of beautiful things to see there
Your happiness is so dear to me
That I am trying to turn this page

We were friends without a doubt
But now I regret all the words
I never told you

And I know
Even intense grief will heal
But my love is not a bubble
It shatters as soon as you disappear

I never had the courage to go for it
Was afraid of losing you completely
But now I feel regret

It's not fair
Because our farewell breaks even more
Love is indispensable
"I need you, I don't want to lose you



I'll come get you tonight
I'll come get you tonight
And tell you everything I thought about so often

I'll come get you tonight
I'll come get you tonight
But it remains with dreams dear sleep now only soft

Do I dare or not
I come to disturb your new life
I do that to him

He does not expect
No, this is not going to be his best day
But my love no, it does not wait
Too much time has been lost

I'll come get you tonight
I'll come get you tonight
And tell you everything I thought about so often

I'll come get you tonight
I'll come get you tonight
In my most beautiful dream, this is what you are waiting for

I'll come get you tonight
I'll come get you tonight
Because there is no pill that will ever ease this pain

I'll come get you tonight
I'll come get you tonight
You are the most beautiful thing the world has ever produced <|endoftext|> 
Sultry summer night
Terrible cliché
You looked at me and asked me
Are you coming with me
I should have known better then
You looked at me so in love already
You saw true love in me
But you, you, you, you; you

You were just a desire
You were no more than that
You were a flight
And a back door
And when I had you
Were you a dead desire
You were no more than that
There was no question of love
You were just something
What I Needed

It wasn't for a night for a life
I have not promised eternity
You should blame yourself
If you have believed in that
I can't stop my heart
A feeling passes quickly
You, you were looking for romance
But for me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

Were you just a desire
You were no more than that
You were a flight
And a back door
And when I had you
Were you a dead desire
You were no more than that
No, there was no question of love
You were just something
What I Needed



Oh why does it always have to be this way
Why is more always expected
After one night

You were just a desire
You were no more than that
You were a flight
You were a back door
And when I had you
Were you a dead desire
You were no more than that
No, there was no question of love
You were just something

Jijijijijijijijijijijijijij

You were just a desire
You were no more than that (You were no more than that)
You were a flight
You were a back door
And when I had you (And when I had you)
You were a longing to die (You were a longing to die)
You were no more than that (You were no more than that)
There was no love (No, no love)
You were just something
What I Needed <|endoftext|> 
Today is a great day for me
my friends and I are going out again.
It's gonna be another night without setbacks,
because we are not just going to get laid.

I am admired here the star of the cafe,
because they fly in but I do not drink



Because tonight (tonight) I'm BOB
tonight I'm some kind of superman
Yes, tonight bring it up.
I am the man who can do everything.
There must be someone BOB,
they can't live without me.

Yes, tonight I am BOB
Woow, tonight (tonight) I'm BOB
Well, tonight (tonight) I'm BOB <|endoftext|> 
Clouseau Inside

Mirror Mirror on the wall
Who is the most beautiful in the country
That's not what interests me
Clean is overrated

Only appearance
You're ugly, he's clean
That's a fast she is fast
A little too fat doesn't seem so good

It's not even time for your true nature
Inner beauty is worth the most
Look at what you have accumulated within

It's on the inside (3x)
Deep inside

Mirror Mirror on the wall
What is going on here
Who's tattooed where
Bleached with extensions



Tons of makeup face lifted
Almost naked just crazy
False lips strange laugh
Everything is possible and everything is allowed

It's not even time show your true nature
Inner beauty is worth the most
Look at what you have accumulated within

It's on the inside (3x)
Deep inside

Who decides what is beautiful
That is only you
If you love yourself
Then you can, yes believe me
You will shine like a jewel
You no longer need glitter on the contrary
Even without rings on your hand
Are you a pure diamond

It's on the inside
(it's inside)
It's on the inside
(here inside)
It's on the inside
Deep inside

It's on the inside
(you can shine like a jewel)
It's on the inside
(you don't need glitter on the contrary)
It's on the inside
(yes inside)
Deep inside
It's on the inside (2x)
In here <|endoftext|> 
That has remained calm for a week
That has been good and civilized for a week
An old lady delivered
No smoking, drinking or hitting for a week
That is long, impossible to bear
Watch how I cook, cook how I watch
I want to travel, travel all night
I'm going out tonight
And nobody can stop me
I'm going out tonight
Until I got it
What the night can give you
If you disappear on fire
I'm going out tonight
A sober life, you can have it
Stick it wherever you like
Good manners come to an end
And where there is an end there is a beginning
That is now, time to travel
Time to go, watch the time
I have waited long enough now
Tonight...
By royal decree, I'm going out tonight
Keep going, keep going, until you can no longer stand on your feet
Tonight... <|endoftext|> 
I talked like hell, that was not even necessary.
You knew who I was, you knew what I was thinking.
I saw you again, every word was unnecessary.
I had waited so long for you.
Never has a dream been so promising.
You had never been more silent than that day.
I got lost in the summer full of hope.
Then the thaw came, a true blessing.
If I could choose the season.
And you walked by my side.
Then I would freeze time.
Heaven was so close.
Then between you and me.
You showed the way, it seemed obvious.
The rain stopped, you took care of that.
The day was perfect, the earth was allowed to shake.
You whispered in my ear.
Never was a dream ..... <|endoftext|> 
Now the lights are slowly dying
And the night overtakes us
I'm not looking for nice words
Because I know what will come
Tomorrow our ways will part
Tomorrow we will be alone again
I can't give you much more
But take this with you

Goodbye know I will miss you
Goodbye, even though it hurts
Goodbye, let time decide
Goodbye and think about me again

We had only recently been strangers
Full of secrets for each other
But we found what we were looking for
In every look, in every gesture



None of us can predict
Whatever life offers
But I can tell you
I will not forget you

Goodbye know I will miss you
Goodbye, even though it hurts
Goodbye, let time decide
Goodbye and think about me again <|endoftext|> 
It is forever summer in the country
what I love
here all the people dance in the street
what I love
pubs close way too late
that's what I love so much
the women here are well built
that's what keeps me busy

CHORUS:
Welcome to the land of Swentibold
Welcome to paradise on earth
Welcome to the land of Swentibold
Welcome to this party palace
Welcome

Pay here with a smile
nothing more is asked
but you know if it were up to me
then the price was reduced
the Swentis speak swentisch
that is completely normal
and who is not used to it
uses sign language



CHORUS

Swentibold, Swentibold, Swentibold
dream paradise
Swentibold, Swentibold, Swentibold
affordable price
Swentibold, Swentibold, Swentibold
your dream paradise

If you sometimes start dreaming
about the land of Swentibold
then ask our king
where he found Paola

CHORUS <|endoftext|> 
The wind broke the silence
But you, you broke my heart
Because I couldn't choose yet
I'm way too young to lose you already

I wander in the night
You let me down I never expected
I keep myself strong and show myself tough
But apparently you don't care

Wherever you go
Or how you stand there
That sweet grin, that sweet grin on your face
It is much too late

You have no idea how I feel
You don't want to talk to me, you stay very cool
Not left me, OK for me
I'll be quiet and very cool with you



Wherever you go
Or who you talk to
Who you make love to or regret
I lost you forever anyway
It is much too late now

Wherever you go
That sweet grin on your face
I don't like it
No no more interest
It is much too late

Wherever you go
Or who you talk to
Who you make love to or regret
I lost you forever anyway
Now it is much too late ... <|endoftext|> 
Hold me in your heart

The day is round
I think about you
Where would you be now

You decide
The color of my thoughts
Because of everything you said

No one ever gave me that much love
That's why I'm happy to give you my life
Hold me in your heart
I want to love you
Hold me in your heart

I'm so happy
Because you kept believing
Despite the doubts on my part



Still you gave me
Your faithfulness and all your warmth
Even though I never sang a song to you

No one ever gave me that much love
That's why I'm happy to give you my life
Hold me in your heart
I want to love you
Hold me in your heart

How long did I search for the words
Yes, how many nights long
But one day this song woke up for you

No one ever gave me that much love
That's why I'm happy to give you my life
Hold me in your heart
I want to love you
Hold me in your heart

All my life
Hold me in your heart
Ah, take me into your heart <|endoftext|> 
I feel the peace
i feel free
because I belong to you
and you with me

deep in your heart
is where I stay
i feel the warmth
for your slender body

if you make love to me
strengthen your belief
in what I strive for
you know what you give
tis for you that i'm alive



you exhale
I breathe in
the source of life
for this young man

and I thank the god above
who watches the world
much closer to heaven
since you loved me

if you make love to me
strengthen your belief
in what I strive for
you know what you give

you give the feeling
life has a purpose
when I strive for you
you know what you give
tis for you that i'm alive <|endoftext|> 
I hear your dull laugh and see
How you stare at me
I remember how you thought
It's worth a try
And now they look at you
They don't even notice you
Today is another such day
That will never pass away

Don't deny it
You don't know what's coming
You defy death
No way out, so take a flight into pink dreams
But you are tough
Oh, so tough
And what's left of you
Is a meager harvest that you bring in
In an empty look that disappears
And never lives again



I hear a voice saying
It's not too late yet
But you are far and I am afraid
That I will follow where you go
Then the day will come when you will tell me
That I am one of you <|endoftext|> 
Oh when you say you belong with me
is that until the end of days?
Is that forever?
Oh when you say you belong with me
I will keep asking over and over
Is that forever?

And if things go wrong
and you no longer see
what you once saw in me
will you keep longing for me?
as on that very first day.

I am not a prince on a horse
and when your passion subsides
do we still stay together?
Will we still stay together?

oh when you say we'll stick together
is that now, today or tomorrow
is that forever?



and when things go wrong
and you no longer see
what you once saw in me
will you keep longing for me?
as on that very first day.

I am not a prince on a horse
and when your passion subsides
do we still stay together?
Will we still stay together?

I feel my speed hit hard
because always cannot exist,
what if love cooled,
who knows what you will feel for me later.

I am not a prince on a horse
and when your passion subsides
do we still stay together?
Will we still stay together? <|endoftext|> 
You understand the language of shaking and grooving a little
Because what I'm fed up with is the stiff stuff you know
So come and shake your funky ass
Your radiant smile is living proof
You get into the mood when you feel that the rhythm is starting to live

We shake jump float swing
This night we dance on the walls
Admit a night like tonight
may last forever

Now you should know
I have nothing against lukewarm
but for me it can be a bit hotter
Because what I love is a dance floor on fire that dances better
So come and let me see what
Your whole body is raging and moreover
When you move, your beat makes you forget your worries



We shake jump float swing
Tonight we think on the walls
Admit a night like tonight
may last forever

You feel swinging
Not to contain
Haleluia long live the beat
Unpretentious, no competition
You're the man, the woman
The floor is yours

This night we dance on the walls
Admit a night like tonight
may last forever
Yes hours and hours
This night we dance on the walls
Admit a night like tonight
may last forever
This night, yes this night
This night may last forever <|endoftext|> 
Die on the shelves
That's how I imagine the end
One last half-sung sentence
Then comes the end or the beginning
The band keeps on playing
And also the girls of the choir
They have not noticed anything
But that is more common
Die on the shelves
A good time to leave
One last look at the audience
I was never more than some music
It has now been enough
I'm going for the end of the party
Goodbye and nothing to thank
I want to die on stage
I want to die on stage
Let me die on stage
Without tears, without melancholy
Not because it bores me
I think I'll leave
For the photos are yellowed
Die on the shelves
If it has to, then it should be like this
Before I close my eyes for good
I sing a little too loud one more time
Howl one more time at the moon
Undergoing under full sail
There is nothing to cry here
I want to die on stage
I want to die on stage
I want to die on stage
Let me die on stage
But not immediately <|endoftext|> 
I remember well
Cold and foggy weather
In September
Evening of yesteryear
Life was so beautiful
With you by my side
The memory is strong
And she stays



Those summer nights
Dancing in the moonlight
I saw you and you smiled
Brown burnt face
Forever in my dream
More and more
That sweet verbiage
Sounds over and over

It's been long nights
Without you
It's raining again
September will be very cold
If only I could be with you again
Then I felt
Much less pain. <|endoftext|> 
She is dancing lithe
Everyone watches it
Many just take their chances
I really feel something for her

Then why are you standing there like that?
No idea, no
It might be too late tomorrow

She her gaze on infinity
Me, my heart in my throat
Someday I have to tell
I doubt too much

Take a deep breath, don't hesitate and talk
I'm looking for words
God knows who is in front of her tomorrow
That's true



Eye contact is okay
Self-control is good
Slightly shy
But I walk towards her anyway

See, they were born for each other
So you see, yeah
If you want to, then dreams come true

Even though I should have known better
And can be here much earlier
Still I am with you
Am I with you
Here today

I was waiting so long for a sign
And took my chance that night
Now I am with you
Am I with you
The whole day

[I'm with you forever
And I never want to lose you
Now I'm with you
Am I with you] <|endoftext|> 
Because your blood runs through my veins too
You play when I sing and vice versa
Because a look between us is enough
Without asking why

Because all these years so close to your skin
Makes our bond indissoluble
Because you're still that little one
And you still watch over me

Because wax binds us encompasses so many things
No word on paper can describe
How everything is sometimes self-evident
And yet can remain so surprising

Therefore, therefore everything is as it should be
Therefore, connected forever
That's why, that's why I'm always by your side
Unconditionally we



Because it is familiar and so new
By things that will never get used to
To make all our dreams fulfilled and gone
I'm still getting to know you better

I can curse you, curse you
And yet I will stick to your heart
And calling for you again because you are my brother
And being a brother is for life

Therefore, therefore everything is as it should be
Therefore, connected forever
That's why, that's why I'm always by your side
Unconditionally

And when we are old, wrinkled and gray
Then we pack all our things
Guitars and lyrics, we travel
And will fill concert halls
Two young hearts, filled with music
With two on stage for our audience

Therefore, therefore everything is as it should be
Therefore, connected forever
That's why, that's why I'm always by your side
Unconditionally we
Unconditionally <|endoftext|> 
well i am who i am
and I do what I do
and I hear what I want to hear
and I see what I see
and I feel what I feel
and my heart is looking for you

Chorus:
sometimes I pass myself
I get lost in the desert
sometimes I lose the north
but I live the way I live
like the sand through a sieve
like the wind, like a running fire

went over the wall
along the bars of time
without fear of pain or regret
went through the wall, over the wall

well I go where I go
and I know what I know
so I shut up when I want to speak
because I want what I have
and I have what I want
but my heart keeps looking for you

Chorus

went over the wall
lance the bars of time
for I have lost innocence
went through the wall, through the wall,
over the wall



went over the wall
along the bars of time
without fear of pain or regret
for I have lost innocence
long went the bars of time
without fear of pain or regret
for I have lost innocence

went over the wall <|endoftext|> 
How do I tell my child in the evening
That the future smiles at us?
Don't worry about tomorrow

How do you explain all murder and fire
For a god or for a country?
That worries me about tomorrow

Not everyone sees today
We can't go on like this
Because there is always that question:
How peacefully is my child sleeping today?

And I hope for a new day
And I hope when I smile at you
That the sun will shine in the heart
And forget how the world fights
Because I know: that will come to an end
As long as you know where everything starts:
The sun shines in your heart

This world is so crazy
Full of war and destruction
That worries me about tomorrow



Everyone is sewn up so quickly
Only concerned with himself
I'm worried, so worried

Sometimes it makes me quiet and sad
And it is still so small
Save my child from all pain

And I hope for a new day
And I hope that with every smile
The sun will shine in your heart
And forget all hate and envy
Because I know the battle will end someday
Even though the nights are gray and cold
There is someone who loves you

There is always someone who loves you
And look
The day begins
And the sun that shines
For you my child

And I hope for a new day
And I hope that with every smile
The sun will shine in your heart
And forget all hate and envy
Because I know the battle will end someday
Even though the nights are gray and cold
There is someone who loves you <|endoftext|> 
If only I got the chance
to give you what you crave so much.
If it didn't work out, it stops here
view it as a trial contract.
I don't have to make much money
just a little fire and maybe some love.

Would you like to give it a try? Experiment?
Then take me on a trial for a week!
I do whatever you wish, greedily and intensely.
It's never enough for a woman like you!

I read the vacancy, with the grin on your face.
I am very flexible, day and night,
and I always faithfully do my duty.
I don't need to strike.
I just want to wake up next to you.



Would you like to give it a try? Experiment?
Then take me on a trial for a week!
I do whatever you wish, greedily and intensely.
It's never enough for a woman like you!

Don't decide too soon, no.
Unsatisfied? Money back, yes.
Don't decide too soon, no.
Unsatisfied? Money back, yes.
Don't decide too soon, no.
Unsatisfied? Money back, yes.

Would you like to give it a try? Experiment?
Then take me on a trial for a week!
I do whatever you wish, greedily and intensely.
For a woman like you it is never ...!
Would you like to give it a try? Experiment?

I do whatever you wish, greedily and intensely.
It's never enough for a woman like you! <|endoftext|> 
I often think about how it started then.
We lay arm in arm in the grass under the sun.
But we both knew there will come a time.
Which gets heavy and difficult.
Because you lose the passion.
And I said we fight and we go for it.
Whatever comes we will get through it.

But when the butterflies die in your lap
Then the life-sized question arises is the love less great?
And the fairytale of the prince on a white horse.
Passed way too soon.
Because the passion has subsided.
It hurts but give yourself another chance.
Only then will your life regain some shine.

Chorus:

So dry your tears even if you are very sad.
You can grieve like me but it doesn't help us.
Dry your tears even if you are very sad.
Life goes on.
You start from the beginning.
There must be something beautiful in the offing.



It is now dark, it is quiet outside.
I ask myself the question again is this what I want.
This is taking a thousand times longer than I thought.
What starts passionately.
You rarely have control over you.
And unfortunately I want to but I can't.
Is it silly that I left you for that?

(Chorus)

It hurts but give yourself another chance.
After a while your life will regain some shine.

(Chorus) <|endoftext|> 
I don't see tears in your eyes
I don't feel any warmth in your heart
so many unspoken words
at the end of the day

chorus: you don't feel anything for me anymore
nothing more for me
why do you look away when i ask you
do not you love me anymore
not mine anymore
why don't you say
I like to see you

so many years together
so much polite
so lucky
we cannot survive this storm
our love will ever return



chorus

but when in doubt
(if in doubt)
and you want to leave
(if in doubt)
and I keep asking you
try again
don't say no
don't say no

if it really weighs too much
well then I won't stop you
no then I will not stop you
Oh no

chorus <|endoftext|> 
It has no words
And there is no language
What happened there
It's a strange story
It takes place in the dark
Against a black wall
Only the light of twinkle
But no causal relationship

Mystery everywhere, and if you ask why
There are no words

Dark shadows
Razor-sharp screams
But don't ask for an explanation
People are of bad will
A threatening finger
Right in the open wound
An obscure intruder
Lit the fire



Mystery everywhere ...

It remains a black world
Who could it be
Who always arranges everything
Everything in secret
It takes place in the dark
Behind a high wall
And you don't look over that
Or do you like to play with fire?

Mystery everywhere ... <|endoftext|> 
I look at you, my eyes get lost
The full moon illuminates and accentuates
What I so desire

You look at me, your eyes translate
Which I keep quiet, because words are quickly too loud
They slip on your skin

There are fireworks in my body
I don't know how to stay with myself

Come on, come on
You still have a lot of my credit
Come on, come on
I have it in abundance
Come on, come on
The deepest love I feel
Come on, come on
I have a lot of them



After all this time, unending desire
That loneliness, I waited for you so long
My heavenly wife

There is passion in my body
I don't know how to stay with myself

Come on, come on
You still have a lot of my credit
Come on, come on
I have it in abundance
Come on, come on
The deepest love I feel
Come on, come on
I have a lot of them

You are worth the wait
We are not always together
But always from each other

Come on, come on
You still have a lot of my credit
Come on, come on
I have it in abundance
Come on, come on
The deepest love I feel
Come on, come on <|endoftext|> 
She is the future for me
I feel good with her
And it is just a miracle
what she does to me

And I want her to be with me
for me she's perfect
yes i want her to be with me
that she never or never leaves

Ooh, and I notice it again and again
I have no defense
and every second is slow
if she can't be with me today ...
Ooh

She has something very special
I can't figure it out
But in a hundred thousand things
she always gives proof ...

I can only say
for me she is perfect!
No, it cannot be explained
I don't want her to leave



Ooh, and I notice it again and again
I have no defense
and every second is slow
if she can't be with me today ...
Ooh

This morning it was very busy again
I had to spend hours in a traffic jam
The ring was closed again, I beamed with happiness
because since I've known her, I can handle anything!

And I want her to be mine
for me she's perfect
yes, I want her to be mine
that she never or never leaves!

Ooh, and I notice it again and again
I have no defense
and every second is slow
if she can't be with me today ...
Ooh

Ooh, and I notice it again and again
I have no defense
and every second is slow
if she can't be with me today ...
Oohooh <|endoftext|> 
See them standing, how those hips sway
The one with her cowboy hat
Look at it and people are staring
God, what an abundance

Come closer to me tonight
You are so perfect and I want you
Come closer to me, I'll wait
k Do you want to, this is going to be fatal to me

2am and the beat keeps going
And she lets herself go again
My patience is working overtime here
Hey how can she resist me?



Come closer to me tonight
Oh, I'm very sorry, but I want a lot more
Come closer to me, I'll wait
I want you all the way, this is going to be fatal to me

All men want her and they whistle for the sport
We aim all arrows but we fall far short

Come closer to me tonight
Oh, I'm very sorry, but I want a lot more
Come closer to me, I'll wait
You're so perfect, God you're driving me crazy
Come closer to me, I'll wait
k Do you want to, this is going to be fatal to me <|endoftext|> 
If someone left me
Just swallow and go on
To turn and just get up again
It didn't affect me much
But I'm sad about you
Without you very insignificant
Your voice stuck in my head
Don't leave me alone for a moment

And that there are people who laugh
And that there are people who dance
And that there are people who kiss intensely
I can't understand that now

I only feel the pain of 'god where is she'
I just feel the pain of you missing here with me
And I can't handle it
I really can't handle it anymore

And I would like to beg
Want to beg you on my knees
If I knew it still made sense
But the days are turning into weeks
And the weeks turn into years
I cannot win this fight
Because you are way too deep inside

Why you
Why you
Why you
Why are you out of my life here
Why didn't you stay
Why didn't you want to give me any more
Why did you leave for no reason



I hold you in my mind
I can still see you smiling at me
I miss your lips on mine
An image that will never disappear
Your hand no longer in mine

So I count the empty long days
That pass without you
With no hope for tomorrow
No hope for anything
But you, will you still think of me sometimes?
Sometimes I am still with you a little bit
Oh nevermind

I just count the long days
Just count the empty long days
But I do not want to
I do not want anymore

If someone left me
Just swallow and go on
To turn and just get up again
It didn't affect me much
But I'm sad about you
Without you very insignificant
Your voice stuck in my head
Don't leave me alone for a moment

And that there are people who laugh
And that there are people who dance
And that there are people who kiss intensely
I can't understand that now
I only feel the pain of 'god where is she'
I just feel the pain of you missing here with me
And I can't handle it
I really can't handle it anymore
After after after after 7X <|endoftext|> 
look at me
did you think we would be standing here together?
side by side
I can not believe it
how many times have I almost left you
or you with me

but every time you were almost outside
then I took your hands
and you came back
and whenever I said I would go
you came after me again
and never have I regretted
never a moment

so why
you tell me now it's over
and why
are you sure
when the water brings us together
to the lips
or either of us
didn't like it anymore
there was always the other who said softly
I love you so much

look at me
we have been in the storm so many times together
in the sea
with houses high waves
we were stronger than the most powerful hurricane
with two
whenever I almost drown
then I clung to you
and you were there
or I came up to you and caught
you up when you almost set
and never have I regretted
no never a moment

and why
you tell me now it's over
and why
are you sure
when the water brings us together
to the lips
or as one of the two of us
didn't like it anymore
there was always the other who said softly
i love so much
I love you so much
so much of you <|endoftext|> 
I know exactly what's going on in her
which she prefers to sleep on
i know her favorite food
which movie she likes or not
see in her eyes if things are going well
whether she talks a lot or not
I can know those things about her
that no one else should really see

but when we're in the pub
I lost her again

why don't you dance with me
I'm on the side here
you just pass me by, with someone else by your hand
why don't you dance with me
don't want to go down the line
don't want half your heart
don't want to be friends
why don't you dance with me

I am the shoulder to her tears
pay the penomets
her compass and her conscience
if she loses herself again
I know her whims and her ailments
the truth behind the stories
her face without the masks
no one comes closer than me

but when we go out together
I lost her again



why don't you dance with me
you put me aside
you just pass me by, with someone else by your hand
why don't you dance with me
don't want to go down the line
don't want half your heart
don't want to be friends
why don't you dance with me

I dream that we will be together forever and ever

I dream that we will be together forever and ever

but just like in my dreams
I really don't want to lose you

why don't you dance with me
put you aside with
you just pass me by, with someone else by your hand
why don't you dance with me
don't want to go down the line
don't want half your heart
don't want to be friends

why don't you dance with me
why don't you dance with me
why don't you dance with me
why don't you dance with me
with me, with me, with me, with me
why don't you dance with me
I don't want half your heart
I am not friends, no, no
why don't you dance with me
you put me aside
you just pass me by, with someone else by your hand
why don't you dance with me
don't want to go down the line
don't want half your heart
I don't want to be friends
why don't you dance with me <|endoftext|> 
Where are you when you sleep
In late November light
And groans every hour
Like a ship that is too deep
See the shadow of summer gone
Dancing on your frail face
See you sunbathing on an airplane
Above the hearth you love
Wherever you are, I'll hold you

Where are you when you sleep
In the late and afternoon light
And stammers every hour
Like a bad poem
See you in a silver car
In the passion of the wind
I'll see you in the snow
Search more about blind
Wherever you are, I'll keep watch

Where are you when you sleep
And I count the duration
In the heat of the night we roamed
And our only light
Shimmer of your tears awaits
Or are you the girl
In the unbroken mirror
Wherever you are, I am there too
Wherever you are, I am there too



Where are you when you sleep
In late November light
And I as the only support
Only have the silence
I'm booking a ticket to the stars
I was raised in heaven
The final answer to death is love

The final answer to death is love

No matter how high you fall
I'll catch you
Wherever you travel
I'll be there <|endoftext|> 
Her silky soft hair
Fall wildly past her face
Barely eighteen years old
But so much older in this light
Everyone walks around her
Nobody comes close
Maybe a day maybe a year
Maybe never free again

Ohoh, oh
Until the morning her
Brings new opportunities
oh, oh, oh,
But her chances are so slim
To be free again like us

Being free
She just wants to be free
Being free
Love was once
She just wants now
Being free
Be carefree and free
Love
Love was once
Until she could no longer be free

She is often scared and lonely
And she longs back to then
Security and warmth
And a loving kiss
She wants to taste life
Without rules or authority
Do all those things
Which almost everyone else is allowed



oh oh oh oh
She dreams her world
And thinks away her tears
oh oh oh oh
How would we fare
To have to stand still forever

Being free
She just wants to be free
Being free
Love was once
She just wants now
Being free
Be carefree and free
Love
Love was once
Until she could no longer be free

And I scream what I think
Nobody bothers me
But she is silent, maybe will come
Then ever free them again

Being free
She just wants to be free
Being free
Love was once
She just wants now
Being free
Be carefree and free
Love
Love was once
Until she could no longer be free <|endoftext|> 
Put an apple on my head
And throw the first stone at me
Hang yourself from the highest tree
My song will ring out forever

Make your mark on my chest
Pitch and feathers on my body
Put that sword on my throat
You won't tear my soul with it

I have love in my heart
I feel the power of life flowing through me here
My eyes open
And my arms wide
The fear and the doubt, I put them aside
And whatever the morning may bring me
Will embrace it like the light of every day
And those few tears
I cry with laughter

Do whatever you want with me
I am free forever

Place your walls around me
Make me a martyr
Bind my hands, shut my mouth
My words are free forever

Burn your brand in my arm
Make me feel all your pain
Smash that whip on my back
You never break my dignity anyway



I have love in my heart
I feel the power of life flowing through me here
My eyes open
And my arms wide
The fear and the doubt, I put them aside
And whatever the morning may bring me
Will embrace it like the light of every day
And those few tears
I cry with laughter

Do whatever you want with me
I am free forever

[Lange Frans]
Drag me through hell and back
My love will find its way back
Like a boomerang or a bungee cord
All I have is my balls and my word
Step onto the Guillotine with a smile
If that's what we deserve
Do you play God I think it's fine
I know who I am and I know my friends
But down the line is not on the ball
Steering is not done from shore
For those who eat when I fall
I die until my love will
Overcome I believe in things
My hope is never duped now
I can't lose at all
I have the love of my kids and a super woman!
A super woman!

[Marco]
I have love in my heart
I feel the power of life flowing through me here
My eyes open
And my arms wide
The fear and the doubt, I put them aside
And whatever the morning may bring me
Will embrace it like the light of every day
And those few tears
I cry with laughter

Do whatever you want with me
I am free forever

Come on, come on <|endoftext|> 
Friends, dear friends
Let me know
How I'm going

Friends, dear friends
Let me know
Where I am

Because sometimes I don't see it
And sometimes I don't hear it
And sometimes I can't
Not only.

Friends, dear friends
Just be honest
To me.

Friends, loyal friends
You can be tough
Feel free.



Because sometimes I don't see it
And sometimes I can't.

And sometimes I want to be alone
A little space to learn
To try it yourself
And that is possible because you give
The chance to hurt me
To correct myself
But sometimes I don't see it
And sometimes I can't.

Friends, dear friends,
Keep me grateful
Keep me happy.

Friends, loyal friends,
Do you want to stay
Here with me.

Just look around you
They are all there for you
Just look around you
They are all there for you
Just look around you
They are all there for you
Just look around you
They are all there for you.

Friends, real friends,
Stay friends forever. <|endoftext|> 
I listened to you with my ears closed
and I heard nothing special about your voice
when you've whispered all those sweet things
you probably thought about him every time

I lay unconscious in bed next to you
and I haven't even felt any hesitation
when I saw your body move without passion
because your passion was meant for someone else

I lack the courage to ask you
or the other has stepped in between us
even though I feel humiliated and betrayed
I'm just too scared you'll go



I looked at you with my eyes closed
and I don't know if I still know you
for my certainty has passed away from fear
that I'm actually a stranger to you

and that I had to end up in this lie
has not only confused me but also injured me
because your body has been touched by strange hands
and strange lips were on your mouth

How quickly someone can put someone else aside completely
and forget !! <|endoftext|> 
Her silky soft hair
Fall wildly past her face
Barely eighteen years old
But so much older in this light
Everyone is dancing around her
But no one comes close
Maybe an hour, maybe a night
but she always remains free

(oh oh oh oh)
Until the morning her again
brings new opportunities
(oh oh oh oh)
she will be next to you
but the morning comes, she will go

Being free
She just wants to be free
Being free
Love will ever come
She just wants to be free now
Be carefree and free
Love
love ever comes
When she no longer wants to be free

Sometimes she is scared and lonely
and longs back to then
Security and warmth
and a fatherly kiss
but she wants to taste life
without rules or authority
Do all those things
that hardly anyone else likes



(oh oh oh oh)
She laughs at the world
and dances away her doubts
(oh oh oh oh)
She looks at you in love
but if you want more she will go

Being free
She just wants to be free
Being free
Love will ever come
She just wants to be free now
Be carefree and free
Love
love ever comes

and she dances and she laughs
and she attacks you
for an hour for one night
but don't think she will stay

Being free
She just wants to be free
Being free
love ever comes
She just wants to be free now
Be carefree and free
Love
Love will ever come
She just wants now
being free...! <|endoftext|> 
I've had to miss you once before.
I had lost you before.
Still I never had to get used to it
not having you around me anymore.
You always found your way to me.
It feels very different now that you are leaving.
Forever

So many memories together.
So much that connects you to me.
So many more things.
You won't find anywhere else.



Life passes.
But you live on in me.
In all that you have given.
What you taught me in this life.
The beautiful things you said.
Dear darling, here in my heart
I'll keep a room for you.

forever.... <|endoftext|> 
I feel you around me.
I only think about you
I hear your voice
I see you everywhere
I always take you
Wherever I am

So tangible
And so close
You hold on
To me

Where I am
There you are
You never actually left
Like a shadow you follow me
Through my house
Through my head
I would be free
But I am not
It's over
But not over yet

I do not know
What it is
But I miss you so much
Whatever I do
Ohhh

Invisible
But so close
You hold on
To me



Where I am
There you are
You never actually left
Like a shadow you follow me
Through my house
Through my head
I would be free
But I am not
It's over
But not over yet

Are your days
Without me
Better than our life
together

I miss you
day and night
so unexpected

Where I am
There you are
You never actually left
Like a shadow you follow me
Through my house
Through my head
I would be free but I am not
It's over
But not over yet <|endoftext|> 
I'm huddled alone
i am a shadow of the man i once was.
My head is empty, my heart is broken
and my hands are still holding you

Ref.
And a day never goes by
I don't feel you anymore
or that I don't miss you again.
And the bed is too cold for me
when it has not been slept by you.

This warm house is getting colder all the time
until time has erased your last traces.

I scream your name and close my eyes
wait for an answer, even if it makes little sense.
I keep believing that you hear my voice
even if it is against your better judgment.

Ref.



Our beautiful house is getting quieter and quieter,
until you can't hear your voice anymore.

Oh, my heart has been shattered, my dream has been shattered
through the loneliness.
Your voice is getting slower, your image is getting blurrier
Oh, I don't want to lose you yet.

Ref.

This big house keeps getting emptier,
because everything is so meaningless without you.

So empty and meaningless ... <|endoftext|> 
Take my hand, look at me
You don't have to be afraid anymore
Give it that weight here
It's mine from now on
See the sun, smile at you
Let yourself be dazzled
Let your thoughts steal, be someone else's forever
You're safe with me now

Just dance with the wind
You are not alone anymore
The music lifts you up
And she will take you everywhere
Have a nice dream, just fly away
I will follow you above the clouds
Where you leave all your worries far behind
You're safe with me now

And for 1 laugh, I will do anything
For that one second, that look
That you know who you are again
Yes for 1 laugh, I will do anything
Because what seems like at a single moment
Is the door to the life you once knew as a child



Oh oh oh
Climb on my back, give your fears to me
I know it's hard, but surrender because believe me
You are free
Safe with me

And for 1 laugh, I will do anything
Because what seems like at a single moment
Is the door to the life you once knew as a child

Take my hand, look at me, you're safe now <|endoftext|> 
For you I take off my mask
I'm not playing with you.
You can see me as I am
but it does scare me.

For you I take off my mask
and hope you see then
I'm just a joker
who laughs at his grief.

For you I take off my mask
I have no more walls.
'Cause you're just so vulnerable
I put down my weapons.



For you I put my mask on
I give myself open and exposed for you.
With my heart and soul,
and love in my bosom.

Because no one needs to know
how fragile and how small,
how anxious and shy,
I can be now and then.

My strength and my weakness,
you get them both.
I want to share them with you
do you want that with me too?

Your lie that gives protection,
with people like you.
You never saw my mask

You only saw me <|endoftext|> 
I'm trapped every night
in the threads of your web
Where I have to hang still
until I'm never homesick again
But I still see the shapes
of your lips on my glass
And your body is still in the mattress

Tie my hands along my body
and then I still hold you
Put a blindfold over my eyes
and I find you by touch
Make my both ears deaf
and I will hear what you say
I am the loser, the loser
Loser in an uneven fight

every night I am chained to a chain of loss
And I can't move until the pain has subsided
in the room shards of our lives lie on the floor
And I still taste your tears in my mouth

Tie my hands along my body
and then I still hold you
Put a blindfold over my eyes
and I find you by touch
Deaf my ears
and I will hear what you say
I am the loser, the loser
Loser in an uneven fight



You chase me where I go
wherever I am wherever I am
You are the shadow behind me
Every second of the day
I hear your voice I see your smile
When will you release my heart again?

Oh I will want to run
but there is no point in escaping
Because eventually you catch up with me again

Tie my hands along my body
and then I still hold you
Put a blindfold over my eyes
and I find you by touch
Make my both ears deaf
and I will hear what you say
I am the loser, the loser
Loser in an uneven fight. <|endoftext|> 
Every morning
I have a problem
I can not sleep
I feel so lonely

And I think this is just happening to me
Because I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come in

Every morning
Same question

Are you there tonight? (3x)
I just want to be with you



Every morning
I think back
To every night
It went too quickly again

And I think this is just happening to me
It's time you came back to me tonight

Every morning
Same question

Are you there tonight ... <|endoftext|> 
There are such days
that a vagabond lives in me
I have to break out
far away from all that surrounds me
then I cannot bear anything
walk nervous and upset
desire is in my blood
to wild adventure

It can happen suddenly
and it falls on me so suddenly
no one can stop me anymore
even my love, not even you
I can't explain it
It's a glow that melts and burns
yes I want to tear myself off
apart from any common sense

They are mountains and ravines
or a hall of a thousand people
or the heat of deserts
that I would like to conquer

Then I tear through the night
from the heat that hits me
a dry white plain
that chases me to the finish line
then suddenly the storm subsides
a peace that recreates me
joy is unfathomable
if you have conquered something

They are mountains and ravines
or a hall of a thousand people
or the heat of deserts
that I would like to conquer



It's an animal that goes wild
that drowns out my fears
the danger that challenges me
Koen I want you to tame me

Then the harbor beckons again
from a house where I stay
then I taste love again
of her sweet warm body
I find the side again
of the life that writes itself
until the turmoil wakes up
and drives me out again

To the mountains and ravines
or a hall of a thousand people
or the heat of deserts
that I would like to conquer

It's an animal that goes wild
that drowns out my fears
the danger that challenges me
Koen I want you to tame me

Open your eyes
and see what I see
I know how beautiful you are
but you don't know it yourself yet

It will be all right,
just wait and see what time does to you
It's too early now
but everything big started small

You don't have to be a butterfly right away

Know that time will help you
just believe what I say
Though your colorful wings seem forever trapped,
yes one day you fly away



High in the air,
you will see the world very differently
Do you feel the peace,
you will enjoy it even if only for a while
Breathe it in
dare you discover love maybe
And when you find her
feel alive with every stroke you make

If you are patient,
it happens by itself
If you want to enjoy,
don't want it too soon

It will be all right,
just wait and see what time does to you
It's too early now
everything big started small

You don't have to be a butterfly right away <|endoftext|> 
I don't care what anyone else thinks of me
My only friends are the sunlight and the wind
Let them talk, I prefer to crash
Than that I have to live with someone else on my skin

I don't care what anyone else says about me
I am attached to my freedom and my own will
Let them talk, I'd rather be bummed
Then that I discover disappointed on a beautiful day

That I am a man without an opinion or face
And without ideals of its own
You can't catch me, I don't owe anyone anything
I just want to be myself

Chorus:
Outlaw, I will not let anyone prescribe the law
Outlaw, I'm someone else, I'm someone other than you



I don't care who likes me or not
I don't give a damn what someone else sees in me
Prefer a free and a stubborn madman
Than having to live with someone else on my neck
I want to be a man with a clear face
And with strong opinions
You can try, but I keep my balance
I just want to be myself

In the morning I bring breakfast to the room
It is still dark and you are still asleep
One leg is hanging from the bed and your hair is mixed up
And I give you a kiss on the nose but you don't notice it

Anne when I see you I can no longer be adjusted
Anne those moments should last forever

You drink your coffee and start talking softly
You can't resist and still you have to yawn
But it's Sunday so we don't have to do anything today
We dive back into the sheets and have sex until midday

Anne when I see you I can no longer be adjusted
Anne those moments should last forever



You lie softly against me on your head on my side
And then I know you love me and that makes me happy

Anne when I see you I can no longer be adjusted
Anne those moments should last forever

Anne when I see you I can no longer be adjusted
Anne those moments should last forever

Anne when I see you I can no longer be adjusted
Anne those moments should last forever Anne <|endoftext|> 
Who was sitting by your side in the cinema on Monday
Very inconspicuous with his hands on your thigh
Is it a lie what a friend told me

I want to believe you but maybe I am naive
Because I found a letter between the newspapers yesterday
With whose initials with your perfume
Have you forgotten



You would always love me
You would always be with me
Is there another you prefer over me?
You would always love me
And you wouldn't be unfaithful
So you lied

Half past eight in the evening and the wait is long
I'm afraid every minute you're late
Afraid of the truth, you don't feel anything for me anymore

You would always love me
You would always be with me
Is there another you prefer over me?
You would always love me
And you wouldn't be unfaithful
So you lied
Do you really feel no more for me? <|endoftext|> 
Every time you look at me
Then I feel that I am at home
Every time I think of you
Then I know that I am correct

You're saving me from my bad dreams
Your love takes me through the night
Should anything ever happen to us
Then know that I am waiting for you

Because my love
I always love you
I cannot exist without you
I always love you
I can not live without you



A heart that says I need you
That says I love you
Such a heart makes words superfluous
And I always remain true to it
You let the sun shine for me again
You are my passion and my strength
If one day you disappear
Then know that I am waiting for you

Because my love
I always love you
I cannot exist without you
I always love you
I can not live without you

If one day you disappear
Then know that I am waiting for you
Because my love
I always love you
I cannot exist without you
I always love you
I can not live without you

I always love you I can't live without you
I can not live without you... <|endoftext|> 
Life has been a blessing to me
full of wild parties, yes I was there everywhere
Trust me, it wasn't that tough, oh no
until that day when I saw her

No one ever did me as much as she did
no, I would rather no one here with me



You are what I want
from May to April
because you make the difference
And whatever I try
I want you over and over again
and always more and more

I jump, I sing, I float, I live for 2
I seem confused and crazy but otherwise everything is OK
I have the feeling that everything is allowed and nothing is mandatory
It's love that does it
I have never thought of anyone that much
no, I would rather no one here tonight

You are what I want
from May to April
because you make the difference
yes ooooh
And whatever I try
I want you again and again
and always more and more
no one ever did me as much as you
no, I would rather no one here with me. <|endoftext|> 
Father stay here for a while
We are not done talking
Even if your life is ajar
It's not too late yet
You don't see father
My great sorrow
I need you


Tell me what you're thinking about now
Tell me what I don't know
You say you are ready
Time is ticking on, and you get used to it
Forgive my sentiment
This goodbye weighs
I feel empty
I need you


Father in your heart I see heaven
A start awaits you
High in the clear sky
The wind will guide you on the final flight


Father I can feel the sunshine
The joy you showed me
I know I have to be strong
The way you are despite the pain
I will follow the way you show me
But don't you see
My great sorrow
I need you




Father in your heart I see heaven
A new start awaits you
High in the clear sky
The road is long, but you will come back
The wind will guide you on your last flight


Is it painful for you
Oh don't fret
Come give me your hand
Because it won't be long anymore
No I don't shed a tear
I can handle it
I'll stay by your side
Until the bitter end


Father in your heart I see the children
They are a fresh start
High in the clear sky
Your smile shines through their happiness
A look in their eyes
And I'll see you again <|endoftext|> 
It often creeps over us
A feeling of regret
But you count on the fact that everything wears out with time

We like to ignore it
But it keeps coming back
And so you can easily remain silent until the last sigh

But when we're dead
Is it too late to do anything?
You can't be angry anymore
There is no later and no then
When we're dead
Everything we felt becomes cold
So let's be big
Say "Sorry, I was wrong"

And we often hurt
Someone who loves us
But are too proud to admit: I was wrong



Actually, you want to
Still you don't know how
But trust me, the way doesn't matter

Because when we're dead
Is it too late to do anything?
You can't be angry anymore
There is no later and no then
When we're dead
Everything we felt becomes cold
So let's be big
Say "Sorry, I was wrong"

We are so preoccupied with ourselves
That we forget what really counts
Isn't it time I called you?

But when we're dead
Is it too late to do anything?
You can't be angry anymore
There is no later and no then
When we're dead
Everything we felt becomes cold
So let's be big
Say "Sorry, I was wrong" <|endoftext|> 
if anything ever went wrong
then I knew what to do
If she left me out in the cold
then I came to you

she gave me heart and soul
but I feel a lot more for you
I can't just leave her
because she still remains my wife

if anything ever went wrong
then my suitcase is ready
if she left me out in the cold
then I don't grieve for her

then I would cry of liberation
because you are with me forever
then I would hide in your arms
sleep in your warm glow

then I'll run to you
then I'll run to you
then I'll run to you
then I'll run to you



there is still so much to do
can I love you forever?
she gave me heart and soul
but she has long lost my love

If anything ever went wrong
then I am not making up for it
if she left me out in the cold
I leave her for good

I let myself drift to your island
don't doubt what you're doing
heaven is now getting very close because
I've never felt like that

now i'm running towards you
woo-o-o-o-o-
now i'm running towards you
Woo-o-o-o-o-

If anything ever went wrong
if anything ever went wrong

if anything ever went wrong
then I know where to go ... <|endoftext|> 
There is no other way
Am I really always wrong
Sometimes I think no one sees
That I enjoy life to the fullest
And that feeling
Makes me so sad
I want you to help me through it
And that you choose me

Just with you



Sometimes I regret
About things I did
But I mean well
Much better than you suspect

I only want to live with you
I can only care about you
Only with you can I be who I am
And do the things that I want <|endoftext|> 
Here I go
The last dance high in the clouds.
I think of you
you are the woman of my dreams

You are my everything, my water, my fire
You are my passion, my strength every hour

Because if you want me
I will give everything
my heart, my soul and so much more
Yes if you want me
I will share everything
until I have learned again
that it was not spent on me

The sun colors the sky
this is the flight to the unknown
oh give me that chance for the last dance in your arms
mmmmm
I want to stay until tomorrow morning
I want to make love until god calls us



Because if you want me
I will give everything
my heart, my soul and so much more
Yes if you want me
I will share everything
until I have learned again
that if I really love someone
no one can stop me here anymore

If you want me
I will give everything
my heart and soul and so much more
Yes if you want me
I will share everything
until I have learned again

If you want me
I will give everything
my heart, my soul and so much more
Yes if you want me
I will share everything
until I have learned again
that it was not spent on me <|endoftext|> 
The world stands still
When I think of you
It's spring in my head

And you are what I want
You take me out of the cold
You make the difference
I just want you

One more little thing I should know
Whether you also feel something
For me

If you want it
I give my life and all that I have
Right up to you
If you want
I conjure up summer and sun out of my sleeve
Only for you



I see paradise
Forever together
Life is so beautiful
There is only one

That one thing I need to know
Whether you also feel something
For me

If you want it
I give my life and all that I have
Right up to you
If you want

If you want it I will leave everything for you
All the madness all the hassle
So much time has passed
I come to you <|endoftext|> 
Well you can burn your heart
To a woman's smile
You can go crazy with desire
You can be devastated by repentance

When the night slowly creeps past your bed
And the silence is too loud
Well then I'll raise a glass to everyone
Which closes the pub last



Because time stands still
When your heart spins in circles
Time stands still
And the wind howls when it blows
I know
It's never enough
But always a little too much
So alone
Only
Then I prefer to stay alone

Well you can sell your soul
To the mirror or a god
You can avoid the fortune teller
But you cannot run from your fate
When the moon moves slowly past your window
And the silence laughs at you
Well then I raise the glass
Anyone who closes the pub last

Because time stands still
When your heart spins in circles
Time stands still
And the wind howls when it blows
I know
It's never enough
But always a little too much
So alone
Only
Then I prefer to stay alone <|endoftext|> 
Everything comes back
Over time
You will get rid of that unrest
Everything passes
So don't despair too soon
One day you will just find your smile back
The pale moon helps you through the night
Just like Galileo
Who one beautiful morning thought:

Hey
Everything is running
In a circle
So just stand firm on the ground
And live
I believe:
Even if it is disappointing
Happiness is in your head

People think retro
What was made yesterday
Just glittered hard, then slated again

But look that retro is cool again
Life moves in waves
And sometimes really blows you off your seat



Hey
Everything is running
In a circle
So just stand firm on the ground
And live
I believe:
Even if it is disappointing
Happiness is in your head

Just before the Wall: acidification, a flat tire
There went the bunch
It was not obvious
But that day he was brilliant
It was a race he won because

Hey
Everything is running
In a circle
So just stand firm on the ground
And live
I believe:
Even if it is disappointing
Happiness is in your head <|endoftext|> 
I sit here at a table all alone
Don't get a letter on paper
Far too much feeling and few words
I am far from here in my mind

Two o'clock in the night, I can't sleep
I wanted you to come
I sit here all alone in my room
Think about you all the time

And when you smile, I feel great, hmm
And you smile all day long



I have no idea what you feel about me
But I feel a lot for you
And you have no idea what you're doing to me
I don't mean anything to you

And when you smile I feel great, hmm
and you smile all day long <|endoftext|> 
Everything is done for good
When you are ready
I've been by your side
Oh God, I loved to know you

I stay here now you go there
And there is not that far from here
We meet up, I don't know where
And there we meet

Without you, the clock is ticking just as fast
But times do change
So I say goodbye, you have to go now
Know that you will always survive in my heart

Sleep tight, you deserve it
You fought to your last breath
And go, go now my friend
And dream relieved forever



Just like before, you will end up
I know you'll find a home very soon
And I repeat what you once told me
In my heart I remain faithful to you

Without you...

And I know I should be grateful
But that's exactly why it hurts so much

Without you... <|endoftext|> 
You are like sunlight
radiates when you smile.
Makes me long
gives me the strength.


You stole my heart and took it with you
you didn't give me a chance when I saw you.
And every time it happens again
how glad I am to kiss you.


Because you are everything to me
with you by my side
I live my wildest dreams.
What a story we write together,
my god i love her.


  with you I find love.
Life and lust.
And if the night brings me doubts
then you give me hope and kiss away worries.
You speak the language I understand
i feel free and safe when you say:




Yes you are everything to me
with you by my side
I live my wildest dreams.
What a story we write together,
my god i love her.


Yes you are everything to me
with you by my side
I live my wildest dreams.
What a story we write together,
my god i love her.


Fame or success,
heaven or hell,
they don't matter to me;
because I have you and you
you're everything to me


All for me,
with you by my side
I live my wildest dreams.
What a story we write together,
my god i love her.


Yes you are everything to me
with you by my side
I live my wildest dreams.
What a story we write together,
my god i love her. <|endoftext|> 
It is dark, it is night
I live very alone
And the radio is turned down
Give away some music

I think of her unconsciously
How her gaze could transport me
How often I go behind the window
Secretly went to spy on her

Only with her everything was as it should be
Sometimes I couldn't get out of my words with her
Only with her everything was as it should be
Only with her, only with her

Was it night or was it day
She was always by my side
With her love, with her smile
And then usually with both



Only with her ...

In the dark, in the night
I often think back to her
And the radio softly plays all those songs one after the other
It was what I expected
Or was it way too heavy
In the dark, in the night I still long for her

Only with her ... <|endoftext|> 
An evening like any other, I listen some music And talk to the walls
I go to the cafe I drink my worries away And dream of adventures
THE door swings open, she straightens her coat
and walks in
her beauty dazzles me
her gaze seeks and finds me
her smile turns me on
She makes me live again, I slowly blossom
The fear has been dispelled, it is missing from my head
her view of the world changes my view and nobody exists anymore
just she and me (x2)

her words are a wonder,
I read her like a book
every chapter is addictive
I want to know everything about her
yet it never seems enough
she never ceases to amaze me
her tenderness flatters me
she follows me, she leads me
Her love sets me free



She makes me live again, I slowly blossom
The fear has been dispelled, it is missing from my head
Her view of the world changes my view
And nobody exists anymore
Just her and me (x2)

Her heart is like a well,
in which I want to drown
Sink to the bottom of her soul
NOW the sun is shining for me, I am rising in self-esteem
the storm in me calmed down since I fell for her

She makes me live again, I slowly blossom
THE fear has been dispelled that mist from my head
Her view of the world changes my view
and nobody exists anymore
Just her and me

Mother nature has no objections at all
for an adventure in human existence
it's playing sensitive strings
Such a ritual will always exist
But no matter how annoying that we find it
there is a word
4 small letters that can devour us
I'll think before I get out again

I sound the alarm
I hit it just on time
Alarm
Don't lose your life
Alarm
I sound the alarm
There is a word

It can happen to anyone
Unless you know who you're going to keep going with
Reason enough to complain about this
If you don't listen, it will cost you dear
The chance is small, but yes, it does exist
So keep your wits about you
You can defend yourself with a means
Get that condom and stick with it



I sound the alarm
I hit it just on time
Alarm
Don't lose your life
Alarm
I sound the alarm
Because it is part of it

Play the lottery without a second chance
Rather sing about something else
very unfortunate, but this is not talk

Alarm
I hit it just on time
Alarm
Don't lose your life
Alarm
I sound the alarm
Alarm
Don't lose your life
Alarm

Alarm
I sound the alarm
Alarm
I sound the alarm
Alarm
I sound the alarm <|endoftext|> 
I often call you adrenaline
you're boosting my blood pressure
cold on the outside, hot on the inside
unhealthy, but pleasing to the eye.
And I who wanted to stay alone
overworked and hypothermic.
I am now personally experiencing
whatever the big game hunter feels.

Adrenaline
in my blood and in my senses.
Adrenaline
it's doing good inside here.

I often call you adrenaline
and peace is an eyesore for you.
You never put commas in your sentences.
You are tense like a bow.
And I who would travel to the moon
not to see a person for half an hour.
I experience to my horror
a need for adrenaline.



Adrenaline
in my blood and in my senses.
Adrenaline
it's doing good inside here.

I often call you adrenaline
and you shorten my life.
You love to fight and you love to win
headlong through every wall.
And I would walk those miles
to get away from the bustle.
I don't know what I would sell
for a little more of this feeling.

Adrenaline
in my blood and in my senses.
Adrenaline
it's doing good inside here. <|endoftext|> 
I can't believe it, time flies
I'm losing count just a little bit
And though the days and years are racing away
Still no trace of common sense to me

It was just eighty-eight after all
It's long gone, but almighty
I still feel like rock 'n roll so much

Most gentlemen grow mature and wise
Fortunately, I only get a bit gray on the left and right
Not much has changed, no, it always has been
Slightly crazy, yes, but party every day



It was just eighty-eight after all
We were young and life was beautiful
And every day was long and beautiful and packed
It's been eighty-eight a long time ago
But even if it seems childish
I still mainly feel like rock 'n roll

Especially in the mood for rock 'n roll
I feel like rock 'n roll
For me a portion of rock 'n roll

It was just eighty-eight after all
We were young and life was beautiful
And every day was long and beautiful and packed
It's been eighty-eight a long time ago
But even if it seems childish
I still mainly feel like rock 'n roll
Rock 'n roll! <|endoftext|> 
I found love last night
And I confess
I didn't know about her existence
I drank love last night
And I got drunk
Oh so drunk
I got drunk
Drunk on her

My heart was open and she
Went inside
Something that had not happened for centuries
Overcome by so much emotion
Filled with passion
Released from doubts
I found my peace
Far from the grind

(Chorus)

Love is 1 million butterflies
In your stomach or in your head
Love is 1 million butterflies
And they stay or they die



Is there anyone who can help me
Is there anyone
Who understands me
She wants to completely intoxicate my body
My whole being
My have and keep
All my being
It screams

(Chorus)

But this time they stayed here
Forever and ever
Eternal and always
I want to let the world know
She belongs to Me
Only belongs to me

I found love last night <|endoftext|> 
I almost forgot
That blissful feeling
A life without love
Is a life without purpose
The days are so hazy
My legs are so tired
At 4 in the morning I think
Oh what does it matter
But my bed is so empty
My feet are so cold
I urgently need to find love
Or I still get stuffy
I want 1 big love
I want 1 long party
I want to be carefree all my life
Unshaven all my life
Kissing like an excited
Funky turtledove
Colors will fade
To a chilly monotonous gray
How can I think colorfully
I want passion in my body
The days are so hazy
My legs are so tired
At 4 in the morning I think
Oh what does it matter
I want 1 big love
I want 1 long party
I want to be carefree all my life
Unshaven all my life
Kissing like crazy
Speedy lovebird
I want 1 big love
I want 1 long party
I want to be carefree all my life
Unshaven all my life
Kissing like an elated
Speedy lovebird
Where is the action?
Is there a party somewhere?
Yes I want to swing like an animal
And I want love
I want 1 big love
1 long party
I want to be carefree all my life
Unshaven all my life
Kissing like an elated
Groovy lovebird
1 great love
1 long party
I want to be carefree all my life
Unshaven all my life
Kiss like a shameless one
Sexy lovebird <|endoftext|> 
Serekunda is a city
With streets without names
Nights without light
And houses without windows
But the doors are open
And the food is ready
And everything I know gets here
Another name

The women walk slowly
To be beautiful for longer
To the rhythm of the heat
On the edge of the desert

I eat with my hands
I'm on the floor
I talk with my eyes
I drink from her mouth
Because she smiles at me
She dances for me
She looks at me
She sings to me



The night is clear
The moon that smiles
I see the stars in the sky
Through the holes in the roof

And the women sing softly
Because they sing what they are
To the rhythm of the heat
On the edge of the desert

And when it rains ... the water dances
In the supposedly dead bed
From a mighty river
And if it rains
All women dance
Because a sky without clouds
Is an enemy here <|endoftext|> 
Crawl under your down blanket
Nobody asks you to get up
You don't have to set your alarm
New times are coming
Because we are going
Traveling
Back in time
So close your eyes
Because it is always night there
You don't have to think anymore
There is thought for you

refr .:
    Sleep tight
    Sleep tight
    You will wake up when the bomb bursts
    Sleep tight
    Sleep tight
    Don't worry about anything



War is for distant lands
Stay comfortable in your bed
And let half the world burn
Nothing can happen to us
We are not kidding
We are so civilized
No one here who hates another here
So forget
What you know
And think a little ahead
But don't think

refr.

And if you can't sleep
Then count the poor sheep
The sheep that flee
And the sheep that die
And the sheep that see it
They are silent and work
There is enough to count
For a sleepless night
do not worry
do not worry
do not worry
Because nobody keeps watch
Sleep tight <|endoftext|> 
Watch the madness with a mask on
And time goes by, but the future stops
There is an open book in front of the open window
In which only the wind looks for a direction

But the water flows by
And the child who dreams in me

And I sit and I stare and I wish I was nobody
No name, no life, no past
Not a day waiting for me
Like a shadow in the night



Not a word is true and the language is tired
And there is no truth fast enough
Watch the closer drag
Walking with difficulty
Because the muse dances
On the tightrope

But the water
Flows by
And the child who dreams in
Me

And I sit and I stare and I wish I was nobody
No name, no life, no past
Not a day waiting for me
Like a shadow in the night <|endoftext|> 
I saw you in a room
Somewhere on the sea
You closed your eyes
While I watched you

I stood there and I sang
You listened to me
And for the first time I wanted
Be the word I write

refr .:
    Twenty years ago
    Written my first song
    And always the same
    Desire that I seek
    What I'm looking for



The first love song
I never finished
It was for someone who
I've never known but exist

I saw her from a distance
I never got closer
Because that which never happened
Does not pass either

refr. <|endoftext|> 
The watches that melt like snow in the sun
Because time has no time for time
And I see how a barrel with a burning wick
Is misguided on the way to the end

And the words hear themselves back
They run away together
The piano that is silent
As a man who might
Been alive for an eternity
And has earned his rest

And I see
Salvador Dali

On the flow of a dream
I blow with the wind
And I see what I think when I sleep
A woman on her way to the next child
Suddenly turns into a sheep

The clouds that follow the trail closely
The choas who knows exactly what she's doing
Heaven that breaks
It's raining mind
The lonely wheel of a bicycle
Looking for a band
The Tower of Babel
Tells a story
An old violin
Looking for another language



And I see
Salvador Dali
And I keep silent
And he says
Don't look at the painting
Just look at me
See me in the painting
Just look at me

What a credo
What an ego
And Picasso
He's nothing
I am everything
What you see
I am a genius
I am
Salvador Dali
It's red what I'm saying
Green what I think
Orange has always been
Far from my bed

I'm on the ground
The chair is on me
I like Picasso
And everything hurts
Because I see
Salvador Dali

Suddenly I wake up
I look out the window
I see the Sagrada Familia

Where is the limit
From what I don't see
What is a fool
What is a genius <|endoftext|> 
Here I am an artist
There I am a charlatan
Here I am a wizard
I know the balls about that
Here I am a thought
There I am a feeling
Here I am on a kill list
There I am sitting on a chair



Here I am a king
There I am a thief
Everything I am is relative

Here I am outdated
The latest fashion
Somehow I'm allowed
Also prohibited somewhere
Here the left side does not see me
There I am avoided on the right
I'll be my best friends
Always in the middle against <|endoftext|> 
Together we are strong
Nobody can go alone
You build a cathedral
With many around you
I've often thought so
Better off alone
But singular is limited
Together we are strong

Together we are strong
The world is so big
The stars are that far
Heaven is so high
It doesn't matter much
No matter how cold it leaves you
Together you are more
You will know sooner or later



It is the simplicity of the twofold
You will not find it if you are looking for it
You don't have to follow anyone for it
It comes to you by itself

Together we are strong
I never believed it
Keep everything at bay
And lived in my head
Until I was mugged
By a storm on the high seas
I got out
But I couldn't do it alone

It is the simplicity of the twofold
You will not find it if you are looking for it
You don't have to follow anyone for it
It comes to you by itself
It lies invisibly in your hands
It's a religion without a church
It is a national anthem without words
Together we are strong <|endoftext|> 
It is late
It's light, it's tomorrow
And today has become yesterday
Come on friend
We raise another glass
On what will come and what was

A new day
The early birds are already up
Within an hour
This whole world is going crazy
Then the cars are side by side
In a way that God knows where leads

Come on buddy, we'll pack in a minute
The first train
Somewhere for the evening
To be in Paris

And I'll show you where I wanted to live
In the Rue de Mouftard
With the woman of my dreams
I was nineteen years old
With the pretense of a poet
Who hasn't written anything yet
And that only in his imagination
Until the bottom has lived

And the cafe where I came
On the Place de Clichy
Between whores and gentlemen
Between everything and nothing
Between writers and painters
With forgotten names
They didn't do much
But they were good at talking



Look outside, friend
The world turns and turns
We all hunt for something
Or be hunted
Let's pretend
No one is waiting for us
Let us travel through time
To what was

To spring
To the parks
The fountains in the sun
Where love was born
Where the end did not exist
To the beckoning terraces
In the Latin quarter
Where I wanted to storm heaven
With my words on paper

And I danced with love
Of my life on the street
Convince the good
Evil beats
And I remember how many times
I hid the truth
If I saw how love
Disappeared in the dark

It is late
It's light, it's tomorrow
And today has become yesterday
Come on friend
We raise another glass
On what will come and what was

Look outside, friend
The world turns and turns
We all hunt for something
That does not exist
Let's pretend
No one is waiting for us
Let us travel through time
To what was <|endoftext|> 
I thought I was happy
had everything well organized
Saw all the stars fall in the night
And every dream came true

Went too fast, but I didn't see it
I passed myself
Then you came, darling
And brought me back to me

Got the flowers and I saw the fame
Got applause every night
And everyone who saw me
But nobody saw who I really was

I didn't realize it myself then
Even if I sang the soul from my body
Then you came, darling
Just right on time

And I want you to know
What I feel now
No one ever came closer
Closer to me than you

I want you to know
What I see in you
You are a star in the night
For me

I had a life that sometimes seems better
Than what it really is
Was without my seeing it
Fighting with myself



Afraid I might lose myself
Sometimes I ran away in a dream
Then you came, then you came dear
And took me out of my mind

And I want you to know
What I feel now
No one ever came closer
Closer to me than you

I want you to know
What I see in you
You are a duty in the night
For me

You make me a better person
You keep the distance short
There is no other I have known
Who can be himself

And also if you ever get lost or scream
I'm here
I'm here and I'm waiting

This is for you dear
Straight from the heart
This is for you dear
Straight from the heart

Straight from the heart
Straight from the heart <|endoftext|> 
East Berlin, Unter den Linden
People walk past flags and banners
Where Lenin and Marx are still on a pedestal
And everyone works, hammers and sickles
While the guards are changed in parade
Forty years of socialism
Much has been achieved in that time
But what is that salvation state
If there are walls around it
If you are scared and careful
Have to deal with your opinion
Well, what is that salvation state
Tell me what's he worth
When someone who is different is considered crazy

And only the birds fly from East to West Berlin
Are not called back, not even shot
About the Wall, about the Iron Curtain
Because sometimes they are in the west
Sometimes also want to be in the east
Because sometimes they are in the west
Sometimes also want to be in the east



West Berlin, Kurfürstendam
There are people walking past porn and peep show
Where Mercedes and Cola are still on a pedestal
And the neon signs that sparkle
Come dance, come eat, come drink, come gamble
That's 40 years of freedom now
Much has been achieved in that time
But what is that freedom
Without a house, without a job
So many Turks in Kreuzberg who can barely exist
Good, you can demonstrate
But with your back to the wall
And only if you have money then freedom is not expensive

And the birds fly from West to East Berlin
Are not called back, not even shot
About the Wall, about the Iron Curtain
Because sometimes they are in the east
Sometimes also want to be in the west
Because there is sometimes bread at the Gedächtniskirche
Sometimes on Alexanderplein <|endoftext|> 
It is manufactured in Friesland
It has a royal name
There are of course other brands
But this one is most famous

You can suck on it for a long time
Bite your teeth on it
And if I used to be in church
It was my salvation and happiness

It was the middle of winter
It was two o'clock in the morning
Someone told me to come
I was expected far from here

I took all the things I needed
And then the journey began
The long way back through the night
Back in place and time

I heard when I had just left
Don't leave me alone now
And the radio was not that loud
But it went right through me
I saw in the bright light of the moon
Rivers in my flat country
I saw that which will never stop
Even though the whole world is on fire

I saw my life go by like a movie
And time turned back
I saw everything before me again
The road to school, the church by the bridge
The voice that sings until you fall asleep
A nest of trust where you ever fail
Then you have to fly, I'm on my way
And my wings are tired
And I'm looking for a nest

Traveling, traveling, traveling through the night
Traveling, traveling, traveling through the night
Traveling, traveling, traveling through the night
Traveling, traveling, traveling through the night

At the crossroads where I had to turn left
A woman stood by the side of the road
She made me stop and told me that she is her home
was turned off
She asked me if she could go with us
She asked me for money that I did not have
Then she offered me her body
I said no and disappeared into the night



So I came home like a prodigal son
She lay there white and still
I kissed her, it was like a dream
What you want to wake up from
She had closed her eyes firmly
And her lips were cold
For the rest, everything around us was so familiar and so intoxicated
And everything else I told her it was
As if I was talking to myself
Like the one lying there in front of me
I had sailed into me
I had sailed into me

Traveling, traveling, traveling through the night
Traveling, traveling, traveling through the night
Traveling, traveling, traveling through the night
Traveling, traveling, traveling through the night


We were together like never before
We sat around the bed
There was longing and defeat and there was
Not much said

Traveling, traveling, traveling through the night
Traveling, traveling, traveling through the night

It was the middle of winter
It was two o'clock in the morning
Someone told me to come
I was expected far from here <|endoftext|> 
I have the same eyes
And get your features around my mouth
I used to be angry, you used to be angry, but we have found our peace

And we sit next to each other
And we don't say much
For everything you do
Do I have the same ritual

Daddy, I look more and more like you

I have the same hands
and I get your wrinkles in my skin
you have your idea i have my idea
and we just wander in thoughts
we always come home.
the truth you were looking for and that
you never found her, i'm looking for her too and in vain as long as i live.

Because Daddy, I look more and more like you

You used to be able to be strict
and god I hated you sometimes
but your words
they are on my lips
 And I'm talking now
Like you used to talk

I have wicked faith
And I love every woman
And maybe I have become
Which you didn't want at all

But Daddy, I look more and more like you

and you believe in god so you go to heaven and i don't believe in nothing so we meet after death after death
never again



But Daddy, I love you more and more

I have wicked faith
And I love every woman
And maybe I have become
Which you didn't want at all


But Daddy, I look more and more like you

oh, daddy, I love you more and more

You had what was on your stomach
Vomited up

No feeling, no idea

The last escape route closed

The sun is rising. The day is dawning
I start, I start from the beginning
I'll start from the beginning



Nothing has been lost yet, even though much has passed
But I can already see towers of the city in the distance

And it's not a long walk and it's a straight road
The gates are already open and the tables are set

And I don't look up, don't stop
And I'll start from scratch
The sun is rising. The day is dawning
I start, I start from the beginning
I'll start from the beginning <|endoftext|> 
Down in my whiskey glass
See you again
I remember how we were
But now my heart hurts so much

The bar's door is closed
A mist hangs in the dark sky
I lift my glass to taste
But in front of me I see your face

ref .:
    Down in me
    Down in me
    Down in my whiskey glass
    Are you still attached to me

I exchanged you for a dream
of a thousand continents
But now I see the bottom of my glass
And I count my last cents



You're all around me here tonight
I feel you in my life
Whiskey is hard and you are soft
You make my hands tremble

refr.

Three ships had to take me away
To countries far from here
But there are shadows on the floor
And visions in my beer

I know I was wrong
My eyes tear, my stomach wants to turn and turn
My future is neither fish nor meat
Three ships betrayed my heart

One night in November
You sit in front of me and keep silent
In a ghetto in Belfast
In a hopeless neighborhood

I look into your eyes
There is nobody home
The doors closed
The lights are out
And you scream in the dark
Screams in the dark
You scream without a sound

Your father fell
On the border of good and evil
For one it was just a report in the newspaper
It's a movie to you
Which repeats itself endlessly



I look into your eyes
There is nobody home
The doors closed
The lights are out
You scream in the dark
Screams in the dark
You scream
Without sound

I would give anything
To be for any god
Who can break the chain
From an eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
The blood feud
The pain

Belfast in the evening
We talk about violence
I give you a hand
I say: Martin, thank you
And go back
To my hotel <|endoftext|> 
This theater is a body
This theater is alive
This theater is a church
For what the church has hid
Here the heart of Louis Davids beats
Here the voice of Sonneveld speaks
This is where Freek de Jonge's storm is raging
Tender violence reigns here
There is a hundred years of tradition here
I've lived thirty of it

And I've never been this small
Never been this small
Never been this small



There is a lie in this theater
Which is not overtaken by anything
Here the power of illusion reigns
Here politicians are worth nothing
This is a harbor for pirates
Here, diplomas are worthless
Here the heart speaks in a thousand languages
Here the helmsmen are speechless
And if you are at the top of the ridge
Then this stage is far away
You may only see a wing
And you may only hear my voice

Because I've never been this small
Never been this small
Never been this small <|endoftext|> 
refr .:
    Nothing is stronger
    Then the silence
    Nothing has so much power
    Like the silence of the night
    Nothing is stronger
    Then the silence
    Nothing is stronger than the word
    That no one hears

So much has been said today
So many people in the world
Have explained so much
Chanting another because of those better knowers
But those better wters should know better
And forget what they know
Because

refr.



Take an advance on death
Feel the silence around you
Who can tolerate silence
Never feels alone
Come here with me, hold me
And don't ask what I feel
Words say way too often
What I don't mean

Nothing is stronger (nothing is stronger)
Then the silence (then the silence)
Nothing has so much power
Like the silence of the night (silence of the night)
Nothing is stronger (nothing is stronger)
Then the silence (then the silence)
Nothing is stronger than the word
Nothing is stronger than the word
That no one hears <|endoftext|> 
One day I will sell everything
I sell everything I have
My house, my hearth
My have and my love
All that has been done
I'm gone

They don't have to tell me anymore
Possessions heavy, I see it around me
Most work to keep what they have
And are insured
For two
I only want

refr .:
    Nothing left to lose
    That is true happiness
    Nothing, nothing, nothing more to lose
    Then nothing breaks

One day I will sell everything
Everything I don't care about
My reputation, my name
You can have them
They are of air, they are empty



No, I am
Not born before this time
You stand or fall with what you own
Money is power
And power is for the one
Who lies awake all nights
Afraid of any enemy
Afraid of who she wants space
Afraid of any uprising
Afraid of when it's dark and quiet

refr.

I will only miss love
So, if you feel like it, you can come along
I don't need anything else
No newspaper
And certainly not a TV

refr. <|endoftext|> 
In the streets of Honfleur
Where Satie saw the world
Along the mouth of the Seine
In the middle of the night
With the lights Le Havre
And the stars in the sky
I dream away every day
Dream that way back every day

To the endless beaches
Where Europe was liberated
It was heaven on a battlefield
Because I never wanted to lose you
And the world and time
Stopped and watched
Because everything was ours
But everything was not enough for us



And these words are my weapons
In a war with time
The future will be past
Most of it is forgotten
You lose most of it
But this love stays with me

And Deauville, the old luxury
The Place m'as tu vu, the rich hell
Where loneliness strolls
With a Chanel mask
It's a done deal
That you recognize the sadness
As long as you are not lonely yourself
As long as you are not lonely yourself

These words are my weapons
In a war with time
The future will be past
Most of it is forgotten
You lose most of it
But this love
Remains
Me with <|endoftext|> 
I see a wall
I see a child
The child looking
The wall is blind

The wall that is silent
The child talking
It is looking for a way out
In a dead end street and

refr .:
    Some day
    The wall falls in front of the child
    It's love
    It's love
    It is love that triumphs



The city is getting old
The country is getting tired
The child grows up
And does not watch

But a breach is made
The wall that cracks
Nothing will be
Nothing will be
Like it was

refr.

Love conquers
The wall falls for the child
Night falls before day
The head falls for the heart
The head falls for the heart
Some day <|endoftext|> 
You stole the fire from the gods
You're on to the truth
Now you will find every door closed
Because the bearer of the message
Usually killed

You take them out of their sweet dreams
Because you don't care about power
They don't listen to your love
They are afraid
Because silence
Silence is strength

You are out of this world
You are out of date
You sprinkle salt in open wounds
And they would rather lose you than get rich
They would rather lose you than get rich

You are not participating in this fair
You don't dance with hatred and envy
And I know, honestly is the best policy
But darling, they have little time



You can only follow the herd
You are not allowed to say what you see
This is the land of the frightened blind
Where a one-eyed is king

You are out of this world
You are out of date
You sprinkle salt in open wounds
And they would rather lose you than get rich
They would rather lose you than get rich

The price of honesty is always higher than you think
There was a time when you paid with your life
But times have changed and now
You just become
Death
Keep quiet

You are out of this world
You are out of date
You sprinkle salt in open wounds
And they would rather lose you than get rich
They would rather lose you than get rich
They would rather lose love than be rich <|endoftext|> 
It's a new day
The road is open
There is light and air
Not much is needed
Not much is needed

It's an old story
It is being rewritten
It is indefinite
For those who dare to give insight
Who dares to give a view

It's a new beginning
It's an open ended
Because that was what
Must disappear in what comes
It will disappear

There is an old fear
Who wants to hold us
There is a hunch
It does not give confidence
It does not give confidence



There are long nights
There are deep dips
There are many thoughts
Where you can get lost
Much is lost
For who keeps dreaming
But what passes away passes away
For what will come

It's a new beginning
It's an open ended
Because that was what
Must disappear in what comes
It must disappear

There are new words
New roads
New colors
Different light
It's a new day
And nothing
Repeats
Nothing repeats
A new day

It's a new beginning
It's an open ended
Because that was what
Must disappear in what comes
It must disappear <|endoftext|> 
Where are the certainties
Where have the certainties gone?
There are no more prayers
And the Gods feel alone

The wall that fell
There is no more East and no West
Yes, everything has changed
What was always good is now bad

If you used to say that the Netherlands was too full
Were you a racist
And you got vomited
The Germans came far in every championship
Now we are after the first round
Already got rid of them

Nothing is like it used to be
I don't know myself anymore
Am completely confused
The voice of henny Vrienten
Is my only gripe



What do you do without Germany
In the rest of the tournament
The enemy has disappeared
So what are we still fighting for

If you score against France
Are you not really a hero to me
No, football is no longer a war
It's just a game now

It had been so beautiful
After 26 years
To beat Germany once in the final
Now they have already gone home
Matheus retires
What should we what should we
Oh, what should we do now

Nothing is like it used to be
I no longer have my own voice
Am completely confused
The voice of Henny Vrienten
Is my only gripe <|endoftext|> 
They say time heals your wounds
But I feel the same pain every day.
Why were you taken away from me?
Why couldn't you just be close to me?
Still the same emptiness in my heart
Still the same hands on my throat.
Angry at the God who wouldn't help you
Angry at a world that won't stop.

I can still see the tears in your eyes
Which you prefer to hide from me.
How small you were, you already wanted to spare me.
You held yourself up and you bit the pain.
I wanted to trade with you every day
I still wish it was me every day.
To see you suffer and not be able to help
That impotence still tears me down every day.

And nobody tells me what the reason is
That everything changes so
Suddenly everything is different.
Wasn't it good, the way it was?
You didn't hurt anyone, did you?
I do not understand

(Instrumental)



I've screamed until I lost my voice
Tormented myself until I felt nothing.
Round the circle again and again,
Until I didn't even know what I was referring to anymore.
I brooded until it was morning
All the decisions I ever made
All the questions I asked
Waiting for answer,
That came from no one

And nobody
tells you how to proceed.
When all you love is
All of a sudden is gone forever.
All is well for one moment.
And then a voice tells you
That it ends.

No nobody
Tells me the reason.
That everything changes so
Suddenly everything is different.
Wasn't it good the way it was?
We didn't hurt anyone, right?
I do not understand

(instrumental)

I get out of bed and start the day
I see the sun but I don't feel its warmth.
I force myself to repeat the words
That you told me just before you left us.
You looked me very deep in my eyes for a moment,
You grabbed me really tight.
"Don't be mad at what's gone, Dad,
But be thankful for what was there ". <|endoftext|> 
every now and then I meet you
in your daughter's eyes
when I hold her in my arms
because she just misses you

I've never talked to you
has time for that
unexpectedly stabbed a stick
but every day is you
always a little extra



you are no longer a stranger to me
although I never knew you
I feel the emptiness just like her
because you are no longer there

when I see her standing there like that
and I see through her smile
I quickly wipe my tears away
and hope she didn't see it

today is father's day <|endoftext|> 
You and me forever.
We carved our names around the heart of this tree.
and love grew with her.

Life was simple.
With open eyes you and I dreamed the same dream.
And every moment was for the two of us.

And my heart breaks when you look at me searchingly.
If you are not sure if I still want you.

(Chorus)
Baby take my hand I'll take you back to where I found you Back to the time our love began.
Because I still love you



Look at me dear and feel my heart reacting to your hands.
Feel how it is right before you feel it burn.
I love you so much.

You still find more beautiful every day.
Especially with all those wrinkles around your smile.
They tell the stories of the years.
And the life you gave me.
I have to tell you more often.
Because I don't want you to doubt for a moment that you are everything to me.

(Chorus)
oooh this is the place where I found you.
Back to the time where our love began.
oooh i love you so much, oh look at me dear and feel my heart reacting to your hands feel it beating before you feel it burning.
I love you so much.

oooh, just like I used to take you to the sun, sea and beach and we celebrate our love every second we can.
oh i love you so much i'm taking you back to how it once started <|endoftext|> 
Why does the water seek the fire
and how the sun desires from the rain
Why does the shadow love the light
Why does the sea crawl to land
and the sand does not stop the waves
Love does not see black or white
She doesn't know day or night
She has so much power
Nobody
Can resist
Nothing can prevent love
Such are its laws
Love can move mountains
so give me over tonight
Why does the snow melt in the sun
and the wind prefers to play with the silence
Why do I keep falling for you
Why does the ebb belong to the flood
and the sky must embrace the landscape
I know you find it difficult
but it doesn't hurt me
that we are different
Nobody
Can resist
Nothing can prevent love
Such are its laws
Love can move mountains
so give me over tonight
When we live
like two opposites
We come together
at the equator
Looking for a new balance
And nobody
can resist
Nobody can resist
Nothing can prevent love
Such are its laws
Love can move mountains
so give me over tonight
Nobody
can resist
so surrender
Nobody can resist
Such are its laws
Love can move mountains
so give up tonight! <|endoftext|> 
I see the valleys where I wandered on the horizon, how it once started, it seems like a lifetime ago.
How I struggled and failed until I finally stood, found my way up, then I was down again.
But before I realized how to enjoy myself everything was suddenly over.

(Chorus)
I never expected it, but here I am again.
Dance the same dance but for so much more.
This second chance at a first time with you, that first time with you.

In the storm, in all the bustle, in the frenzy, I lost you, but I was allowed to find you again.
And that I can embrace you now, I get that chance again, this opportunity, to start over with you.
I had to lose you to feel how good it was all this time.

I never expected it, but here I am again.
Dance the same dance but for so much more.
This second chance at a first time with you, that first time with you.



Ooh I know all moments pass once.
The leaves on the tree fall to the ground.
But experiencing this with you really stays with me forever.

I enjoy so much more, this second first time ...
T 'is a second chance at a first time ...

I never expected it, but here I am again.
Dance the same dance but for so much more.
This second chance at a first time with you, that first time with you.

I never expected it, but here I am again.
Dance the same dance but for so much more.
This second chance at a first time with you, that first time with you. <|endoftext|> 
Nothing in my hands
I am as heavy as my own weight
I live on love, the air and the light

all my thoughts
they dance like leaves with the wind
nothing on my mind
I'm as happy as a child

what's more
even more than this
more than the sun that heats my body
more than the time I have

say it...
{Chorus}
I do not know
I don't feel it
and that's good because I don't have to
I'm not looking for it
so i dont like it
what i miss
whatever else is there, I don't care
I am satisfied ... with nothing at all ...
with nothing at all ... nothing at all ...

My feet are free
free to come and go wherever I want
free to feel that I love you

Free to share
everything or nothing
It don't make any difference
this is my heart and I give it to you




what's more
even more than this
more than the sun that heats my body
more than the time I have

hey say it ...
{Chorus}
I do not know
I don't feel it
and that's good because I don't have to
I'm not looking for it
so i dont like it
what i miss
whatever else is there, I don't care
I am satisfied ... with nothing at all ...
nothing at all ... with nothing at all ...

whatever I do
wherever I go
I'm chasing my own happiness
what more do I want than to exist ...

say it...
I do not know
I don't feel it
and that's good because I don't have to, no

I'm not looking for it
so i dont like it
I am satisfied with nothing at all ...
I do not know
I don't feel it
and that's good because I don't have to, no

I'm not looking for it
so i dont like it
I am satisfied with nothing at all ...
I do not see it
I don't hear it
and that's good because I don't have to no

I do not have it
no I don't have to
i am satisfied with nothing at all
nothing at all ... with nothing at all ...
what I'm missing, what's next, I don't care, I'm satisfied with nothing at all ... <|endoftext|> 
It's not very big
but I don't need more than this
The place I know
Here I charge
A place to rest
Yes, here I can be who I am

Oh, how nice it is to be home again
Even more beautiful than the most beautiful trip
I feel it right away, the security
Nowhere as safe as in my own little piece of paradise

How great she is
Its mountains and valleys
Her land, oceans, the sky
I look around, I take a very deep breath
and yet I want to go back again and again

Oh, how nice it is to be home again
Even more beautiful than the most beautiful trip
I feel it right, the recognisability
Nowhere am I happier than in my own little piece of paradise

Every time I leave, I look back for a moment
And I reflect on what is hiding behind the window by the balcony
Everything that my heart is so dear to, what it's all about
Which will best describe me, when everything else passes



The feeling that I belong here, I always take it with me
Because of what awaits me when I return, I am nowhere really alone
I recognize the fields and the roads, the route with my eyes closed
I know it is not far

What is most important I have missed the most
The smell of your hair, the color of your eyes, that radiant smile
that keeps enchanting me
The door that swings open, there you are
I know I am home
I am home

Oh, how nice it is to be with you again
Nowhere am I happier than in my own little piece of paradise
My own little piece
Oh how nice it is to be home again <|endoftext|> 
Ah"
from the moment I saw you I was immediately sold
you let my feelings get lost in a maze blinded by love
I kept chasing you and you could do whatever you wanted
because I kept standing next to you anyway.
I've told you far too many times that you take and I keep on giving
but you never seem to hear me so I stand here on my stripes
and for the very last time I put my heart in your hand
don't break it, it's the last chance.

Marco Borsato:
this is my voice this is who i am
this is the person you never really knew
and this is in my head and these are my ideas.
these are the thoughts I never dared to share.
this is my heart, this is what i feel
this is what I have been saying in silence all along.
this is my voice, this is who i am, this is who i am



Gers:
I was in the back of the classroom knows you didn't like me
because you couldn't raise me because I don't breed with you
even though you looked down on me your words couldn't touch me
you felt for more and I just let you in your values
I have different principles, very different ideas
what another thinks of me I didn't really care at the time
cause i always follow my dreams keep going until i am done
with the future in mind, I fight for what I am worth
i have pride, honor and look i am myself at all times
this is my voice
i have pride, honor, and look i am myself at all times
this is my voice

Marco:
this is my voice this is who i am
this is the person you never really knew
and this is in my head and these are my ideas.
these are the thoughts I never dared to share.
this is my heart, this is what i feel
this is what I have been saying in silence all along.
this is my voice, this is who i am, this is who i am

this is my life
these are all my wishes
everyone is welcome but I have both my limits
for this here is my home here i am loving
your heart is open and maybe I'll let you in
this is my fight here ....
these are the conclusions of my failure and catches me
this is my voice
this is who I am <|endoftext|> 
I open my eyes
And look around me
To something that I recognize
I don't remember anything
How I got here
Or where I am
An abyss for me
Behind me what it seems, on a way back
But something in the landscape
That is wrong here
It won't let go of me
The promise to you

The water is deep
Your eyes in which I will drown
The waves are high, and the sea is wild
Where I will sink for sure
I look down over the edge
Into the infinite depth
But I am already clean
And lost my reasons
And I know it's just
Just a matter of time

CHORUS:

Until I jump and I fall
Endlessly deep with my heart for you
Here in my hands I let it go
Hoping you catch it
My principles aside
All my fear on the side
I do what I never dared
I forget what I thought for years
That I knew
So I hope you see through the fog
That I fall here for you


Loud are the voices
Who want to command me to go back
Mercilessly hard is the rain of words That forces me to stand still
Far is the lightning that wants to distract me
But I don't see her
But my head is the reins
Long lost from my heart
And I know it's just a matter of time




Chorus 1x

And for a moment, I keep floating
In the calm before the storm
I linger in the void

Eyes focused, on a point in the distance
Take my breath
I push myself off and start running
Getting harder and harder
Until I no longer feel the ground

And I jump!
I jump!
My principles aside
All my fear on the side
Everything I've never dared
So let it storm
And let it blow
Even if I sail this ship to the sharks tonight
I don't care
No I don't care
All that matters to me is;
I'm falling for you <|endoftext|> 
Relax in fierce, wild waves
Through the surf of your love I become
buried
In your eyes (eyes eyes eyes)
Do I want to sink? Hmmmmm
I want to drown in your sea of ​​love

Stack on you
If no other
Stack on you

I see the clouds exaggerating
I want to stay here all my life
This cannot be described by anyone
I am from my toes

Stack on you

When I go swimming in your eyes
Then I will never be on dry land again
I am getting sucked further and further away
I am from my toes
Stack on you

Yes to you
On you
On you
What a woman

(you are an ocean)
A sea
(into which I want to perish)
Take me with you
(in which I want to drown)
What a wonder
(in oceans)
Submerged
(I'm getting buried)
In your eyes

Every word you say
(every word you say)
Let me float Hmmmm
What you do
(what you do)
What you say
(what you say)
It doesn't matter
Because I am



Stack on you
Like no other
Stack on you

I'm completely submerged
You are my eighth wonder of the world
My dear I think you are so special
I am from my toes

Stack on you
You let me float all day long
You are my whole life
You really can't give me anything more beautiful
I am from my toes

Stack on you
Yes to you
On you
On you
What a woman

I want to live in you forever
(If there's room in your heart)
If it's possible
Then let me rest
in your loving hands

Stack on you like no other
Stack on you like no other
Stack on you
Stack on you like no other

Down in love

(Stack up on you) <|endoftext|> 
Stop the clocks
"I don't want tonight to be tomorrow again
That this moment once belongs to a distant past
I never want to lose it again, stop time
"Life brought us together at this point last night
I've dreamed of it, but I never expected
That every step and every decision I took so far would lead me here

With you tonight
All the stars seem to be in the right place
So close to you, until the sun comes up
Oh I never want to lose this again
Stop the time tonight

Hold me
Make sure that this moment can never disappear
That with every scent or look it can reappear
How you smell now and how you smile and how I feel now
Put it in my head and put it on my heart

With you tonight
All the stars seem to be in the right place
So close to you, until the sun comes up
Oh I never want to lose this again
Stop the time tonight



And I'm pushing counterclockwise with all my strength
But I can't manage to slow them down
And the sand slides effortlessly between all my fingers

So close to you, until the sun comes up
Oh I never want to lose this again
Stop the time tonight

Tonight

Look at me
Know that I will never forget this moment <|endoftext|> 
Sleep tight
 Rest this night
 Tomorrow will be back soon
 And sleep tight
 You will be expected soon
 Later everything goes so quickly
 As the years go by
Taking care of each other
 You find me again and again
 Will you stand next to me
 Will you move on
 And whatever you find
 You are always and forever a child
 Sleep tight



Sleep tight
I'm here waiting for your smile
 And tomorrow will be right back
 And sleep tight
 Soon it will be your day
 Later everything goes so quickly
 And as the years go by
 Taking care of each other
 You find me again and again
 Will you stand next to me
 Will you move on
 And whatever you find
 You are always and forever a child
 Sleep tight

Sleep tight <|endoftext|> 
We stand shoulder to shoulder
I looked sideways for a moment
The look in your eyes says it all to me
The world is full of open opportunities
Anyone who is afraid of mistakes never gets it right

Sun or rain
Downwind or against
When we stand shoulder to shoulder
Will it go by itself
Blind with confidence
Half a word is enough
Shoulder to shoulder
Like someone is carrying you
The best is ahead of us
The best is ahead of us
When we stand shoulder to shoulder
When we stand shoulder to shoulder

Shoulder to shoulder
With the same goal
From the same wood
With the same feeling
And we can handle whatever happens
As long as we're shoulder to shoulder



Sun or rain
Downwind or against
When we stand shoulder to shoulder
Will it go by itself
Blind with confidence
Half a word is enough
Shoulder to shoulder
Like someone is carrying you
The best is ahead of us
The best is ahead of us
When we stand shoulder to shoulder
When we stand shoulder to shoulder

When we stand shoulder to shoulder
When we stand shoulder to shoulder

Shoulder to shoulder with the same goal

Sun or rain
Downwind or against
When we stand shoulder to shoulder
Will it go by itself
Blind with confidence
Half a word is enough
Shoulder to shoulder
Like someone is carrying you
The best is ahead of us
The best is ahead of us
When we stand shoulder to shoulder
When we stand shoulder to shoulder
When we stand shoulder to shoulder <|endoftext|> 
I see how your mother's eyes shine
Love has touched her
I'm looking for a sentence that can translate
What you have released in me

Just sleep
And know that you are welcome
We live in the moment
That you will be here with us
Just make sure you grow bigger
You already have a name for us
Your crib is already by the window
So take your time



I got a signal from you
And listen to how your heart beats
I feel you move every now and then
When you kick to life

Just sleep
And know that you are welcome
We live in the moment
That you will be here with us
Just make sure you grow bigger
You already have a name for us
Your crib is already by the window
So take your time

Now sleep
And wait for a good time
You know you are welcome
So take your time <|endoftext|> 
The same eyes, the same mouth, the same smile,
We're gonna look more alike every day
I'm so proud to be so close to you
I love you,

I've known you since long as you've been around
I carry you with me no matter where I go
I wouldn't know what it would be like without you
I love you,

I belong with you, you belong with me
We stay together forever
I will never leave you alone,

You make me happy
I'll hold you and set you free
And I trust that you know the way
But secretly I watch a bit,

I belong with you, you belong with me
'Cause you are me and I am you
And that's forever
Forever together,

I belong to you and you belong to me
Best friends forever,
When I look in the mirror

Then I know that I look like you
I see the world through your eyes
Could I dream on your
You put me in a super atmosphere,

Relive everything for the first time
I live and I learn and I am not afraid
Because I know that you catch me

You're the man, I'm the man
You lead the way and I take your hand
For your first day, until the last day,



For your first tear, until your last smile,
I carry you close in my heart
Together we are forever

I belong with you, you belong with me
We stay together forever
I will never leave you alone,

You make me happy
I'll hold you and set you free
And I trust that you know the way
But secretly I watch a bit,

I belong with you, you belong with me
'Cause you are me and I am you
And that's forever

Life passes us too quickly anyway,
But what a lot of beautiful moments we share,
When I need you you're there for me
I love you,

I belong with you, you belong with me
We stay together forever
I will never leave you alone,

You make me happy,
I'll hold you and set you free
And I trust that you know the way
But secretly I watch a bit,

I belong with you, you belong with me
'Cause you are me and I am you
And that's forever

Forever together. <|endoftext|> 
Look at me
did you think we would be here together?
side by side
I can not believe it
How many times have I almost left you
or you with me
But every time you were almost outside
then I took your hands
and you came back
And whenever I said I'd go
you came after me again
and never have I regretted, never for a moment

So why are you telling me it's over
and why are you sure
when the water reached our lips together
or one or two didn't like it anymore
there was always the other who said softly
I love you so much
so much of you



Look at me
We've been in the storm together so many times,
in the sea
with towering waves
we were stronger than the most powerful hurricane,
with the two of you

Whenever I almost drown
then I clung to you
and you were there
or I came up to you and caught
you up when you almost set
and never have I regretted
no never a moment

And why are you telling me it's over
and why are you sure
when the water reached our lips together
or if one or two didn't like it anymore
there was always the other who said softly
i love you so much i love you so much
so much of you <|endoftext|> 
Red has long ceased to be red
The red of red roses
The color of love from yesteryear
Seems chosen by hatred

That beautiful red was once for me
The color of passion and of wine
I want her back, that beautiful time
But it seems long gone

And all images on TV
Of blood and war around us
Do not really contribute to that either

So I make a very conscious decision
I put the newspaper away
And the TV turns off

Today red is the color of your lips
Today red is what is supposed to be red
Today red from red to white is blue
From all my heart to you
Scream from the red roofs that I love you
Today red is just love again between you and me


I walk through the door and out where the sun begins to shine
Leave everything behind, look ahead and with my last red cent
I buy too big a bunch of 150 red roses
One for every year I hope you are still with me



Today red is the color of your lips
Today red is what is supposed to be red
Today is, red from red to white to blue
From all my heart to you
Scream from the red roofs that I love you
Today red is just love again between you and me

Now you are right here in front of me
The red evening sun caresses your face
You are a miracle to me
I think, while a thorn pricks my finger

Red is my blood that falls to the ground
And for a moment I seem lost
But you bring my fingers to your mouth
And you kiss them
And I know

Today red is the color of your lips
Today red is what is supposed to be red
Today is, red from red to white to blue
From all my heart to you
Scream from the red roofs that I love you
Today red is just love again between you and me

Today is red

Throw out the runner
And drink a good glass of wine
Seize the day because it could suddenly be the last
Today red is just love again between you and me

Today red again stands for love
Between you and me <|endoftext|> 
Old and discarded
in a street without trees
she sits in front of the window
not taken seriously by anyone

Old and discarded
even by her own sons
those with their wife and children
live four blocks away

Alone on her birthday
then they still arrive
but last year when they are
left after an hour

Old and discarded
in a flat with small windows
he recognizes the faces
but doesn't remember names



And he would like to scream
of loneliness and pain
his end is his comfort
because then everything will be different

Dependent and lonely
not in society
we run at rapid speed
past him and her

we don't think about later
and keep them small
until we get old too
and will be very lonely

Old and discarded
he spends his time dreaming
Visiting time is over
they have not come again <|endoftext|> 
I walk on the ruin
of my feeling for you
Which is now only rubble
was once a large building

And even the fundamentals
of what has stood here
Are after some nice springs
more or less gone

That's how we lost the rooms
of our own castle in the air
Wrecked with big hammers
and now nothing is whole anymore



Is this the house we kissed
where we partied and rested
Is this the place where we make love
and did so many beautiful things

I miss the steps to the stars
and the large fireplace

The home of our love
has been declared uninhabitable <|endoftext|> 
That thin shirt of his
So tight to the point that I imagined everything
And that childlike air
I never told him but I was crazy about it
And clear summer evenings, the sea, games, fairies
And the fear and the desire to be naked
A kiss with salty lips, a fire, a laugh
And make love down at the lighthouse
I really love you, I love you I swear, I love you, I really love you

And she
She looked at me suspiciously
She then she smiled at me and held me tight, tight
And me
I have never understood anything
Since now I don't get it out of my mind
That she, she was

A little big love
Just a little big love
Nothing more than this nothing more
I miss it so much
About her That of her little big love
Now that I know what to say
Now that I know what to do
Now that I want a little big love



That strange walk
Even in the midst of who knows I would have recognized her
She told me "You are a landslide"
But I never believed this thing here
And long, frantic runs to meet fallen stars
And hands more and more anxious about forbidden things
And the out-of-tune songs scream to the sky above
"Who gets to that wall first"
I'm not sure if I really love you
I'm not, I'm not sure

And she
All of a sudden she didn't speak
But she could see clearly in her face that she was in pain
And me
I don't know how long she cried
Only now am I realizing it
That she, she was

A little big love
Just a little big love
Nothing more than this nothing more
I miss it so much
About her That great little love of hers
Now that I know what to say
Now that I know what to do
Now that I want a little big love <|endoftext|> 
I got to taste your love
I still have your taste in my mouth
I failed to recognize you
while you were so close to me
before I knew this was your heart, it was on the floor in front of me

that look of disbelief and doubt
I can't get it out of my head anymore
the beautiful smile you made I wiped away forever
and all the tears in your eyes have put out the fire immediately

and now you don't belong to me anymore
within sight of the harbor
I will stay alone forever
I can't hit you anymore
I spin around and around in circles around you

I can't seem to forget you, no matter where I am
even in the dark or the silence
I see you, I hear your voice
I am doomed to this world now that I know your love

Because you don't belong with me anymore
within sight of the harbor
I will stay alone forever
I wander around in the water
think of the past, dream of later
and the light of your beacons
hold my heart forever
I can't hit you anymore
I spin around and around in circles around you



if I could choose I would like to erase everything
you can't miss what you don't know
within sight of the harbor
I turn around and around and around and around and around and around in circles
I spin around in the water
think of the past, dream of later
and the light of your beacons
hold my heart forever
I can't hit you anymore
I spin around and around in circles around you
around you <|endoftext|> 
What will happen when the sun stops smiling for us
and the day is as dark as the night?

Then you look at the sky with tears in your eyes
and out of love for you the sun comes back

What will happen if the rain doesn't water the flowers
when they all wither and the brook no longer flows?

Then the wind tells it that you don't laugh anymore
and out of love for you the rain comes down

But what will happen when I'm no longer with you?
Yes, my dear Smurf, I think that would be bad



What will happen if I no longer see the moon in the evening
if he doesn't smile for me when i go to sleep?

Then you look up to the sky with sorrow
and out of love for you the moon rises again
What will happen when the bird no longer sings in the garden?
and if there is no more song on this earth?

Then you cry - and the bird too, it hurts
and out of love for you he sings more beautifully than ever

But what will happen when I'm no longer with you?
Yes, my dear Smurf, I think that would be bad

But what will if we part?
Believe me, my dear Smurf, this will never happen
Believe me, my dear Smurf, this will never happen <|endoftext|> 
I watch the day go by
the hands of the clock
stare aimlessly into the void
i look for color in me
the floor under the sofa has remained off-white
the room where it was always warm and safe for me
I don't know her again

I can hear you talking in the silence
you whisper in my heart
I put the key at the front door
when I don't expect anyone anymore
I tapped your shoulders gently
when you were someone else
because you don't disappear
because you stay with me



everyone dances at the party
I see them passing by
in a world without words
I avoid the last dance
I don't have the strength anymore
to belong somewhere
maybe for the better
I'm leaving this place
and that I forget you

I hear you talking in the silence
you whisper in my heart
I leave the key at the front door when I don't expect anyone anymore
I tapped your shoulders gently
when you were someone else
because you don't disappear
because you stay with me <|endoftext|> 
I open my hands
but I don't have to look at what you gave me.
I don't look for anything in your eyes, nor do I need to understand your thoughts.
Because I know exactly what to do now this time it really comes down to it
The very last game we will ever play and
I only have a chance by coming along

It's now or never, all or nothing
I will go with you forever and ever
it's black or white, whether I win or lose
but if I don't choose now I'll definitely, definitely lose you

The game of our love is starting to bore you. I keep changing the rules
First I give in and then the game suddenly stops counting
It's the last hand you ever deal me, now is the time for me to open it

It's now or never, all or nothing
I will go with you forever and ever
it's black or white, whether I win or lose
but if I don't choose now I'll definitely lose you



Your cards were open for me to read
I'll show you mine now

it is now or never, all or nothing
and I choose you, I'm sure

It's now or never, all or nothing
I will go with you forever and ever
it's black or white, whether I win or lose
But if I don't choose now, I'll definitely lose you

It's now or never, all or nothing
forever and ever
but if I don't choose now I'll definitely lose you

So look me in the eye
trust me your hand and we'll put the cards away. <|endoftext|> 
The evening sun falls on streets and squares
The golden sun is sinking in the city
And people who disappear into their homes tired
They have had the day again

The neon sign that winks along windows
It is drizzling softly on the street
The city seems dead, yet there is music
From a door that is still wide open

refr .:
    There in that little cafe on the harbor
    There the people are equal and happy
    There in that little cafe on the harbor
    Your money or who you are no longer counts

The counter is made of copper, yet there is no runner
The football club is on the wall
The pull box that makes more noise than the jukebox
A beer that is not expensive



A person there is a person, rich or poor, it is warm there
No monsieur or madam, but WC
But the glass was rinsed in the clearest water
Yes, it is a very good cafe there

refr.

The world problems that are between two glasses
Beer dissolved forever
There is your bill on the edge of a beer mat
Or you owe it

The only food you can get
That's a hard-boiled egg over there
Fortunately, the people who are there
Yes the people there are still happy

I used to spend hours sitting on Grandpa's chair
He always told me a story
Or we went to watch the waves together
And people all knew Grandpa

Yes I remember how we could keep smiling
About a dog that played there on the beach
And that just started barking at the waves
Or wanted to fight with a newspaper blown away

And so we often walked very pleasantly hand in hand for long ends without saying a word
and then I looked back and saw my little feet next to my grandfather's big steps in the sand

But now I am walking alone because my grandfather is not walking with you
And I bring my little tears to that very big sea
I can still see my grandfather as a silent white doll
Grandpa closed his eyes forever and he never saves them again

But now I am walking alone because my grandfather is not walking with you
And I bring my little tears to that very big sea
I can still see my grandfather as a silent white doll
Grandpa closed his eyes forever and he never saves them again



A thousand birds raved about Grandpa's steps
it's just my own feet standing there
But I still know his stories and his jokes
and I remember what I did to him

And so grandpa continued to live a bit because memories will never be lost
And he's given me so much good advice so he's just going to be my grandpa forever.

where my crib used to be
is not far from here
luck has surrounded me all these years
between blossom and trees
I could dream carefree
and luck I could already start saving there
it was at a very small station
where my life began then
I learned to walk there from my parents
there then left my train
I should be grateful for it
now i am big but i was small

chorus
thank you dear parents thank you for life
thank you dear parents for what you have given me
I only now fully understand what you have done for me
thank you for letting my crib stand in your house



you were sometimes saddened by me
but someone else doesn't know that
yet you always loved me
and god gave me a lovely wife
and a child I love very much
with which I built my life together
and I think back to that station
where my life began then
where the train first started running
we knew joy and pain but i will be there
be grateful for
now i am big but once i was small

chorus

thank you dear parents
thank you for life
thank you dear parents
for what you have given me
I understand only now
what you have done for me
thanks for my crib
in your house
thank you dear parents
thank you for life
thank you dear parents
for what you have given me
I only now fully understand what you have done for me
beg that my crib could be in your house someday <|endoftext|>

refr .:
    How many years we have to miss each other
    I don't know, I don't know
    But what fate will decide in the future
    Don't forget me, don't forget me

Fate decided about you and me
The dire necessity in society
The words of peace caress the existence (???)
Obligate me to leave you for a long time



refr.

Goodbye my love, always stay true to me
All my thoughts always stay with you
When I come back I feel happy with my soul (???)
I wear when my bride shares the paradise of love (???)

refr .:
    You were a mother to all of us
    A mother of red, white and blue
    You were a true friend all these years
    A support and trust for your family too
    You were a mother to all of us
    That's why saying goodbye hurts a bit
    But we will all be glad that soon in your place
    Will be a princess with a smile



Even though dangers threatened
You always came with good advice
Calmed you storms
You were on standby day and night
Every year on your birthday
The whole of the Netherlands was at the forefront
Rest assured, also in the future
Will it always be that way

refr .:
    When the roses are in bloom again
    Then a ship brings a sailor home
    Who will long again and again
    To the small village and your own small house

His oldies stood at the quay
When he would go out of the tidal inlet
He waved happily from the railing
But there was a tear in his voice



refr.

Then came the winter storms
His ship sank ingloriously into the sea
His promise was gone forever
Which he had done to the deer

When the roses are in bloom again
Then two oldies are standing by the deer
They stare into the wide distance
The endless cruel cruel sea <|endoftext|>

Jantje was a small toddler
The only child, very spoiled
And one day Mother said
Listen, dear guy
If you are sweet it will come soon
A sister or a brother
Well that was a bit of a jantje
And the little guy then said happy
When a sister came
Did she get something nice from me, Mom

Then my piggy bank opens
Then that sweetheart gets
A bouquet of white roses
What Mommy loves so much



When the stork was expected
Jan had to go with his aunt
And he was there for a day
There the merry box
For the money from Jantje's piggy bank
Yes that counted ten times
Was there in a flower shop
Order a bouquet in haste
And at night in bed still in his sleep
Said the little boy in his dream

My piggy bank will open soon
Then that sweetheart gets
A bouquet of white roses
Whatever Mom loves so much

The other morning upon his return
Then Jan thought, how strange today
Take a look aunt the curtains
Its all the way down now
Sobbing, his father Jantje spoke
Now you have no more mush
She went quiet with little sister
Way to our dear lord
And gently Jan put the bouquet
Down in bed with the dead sister

And weeping then Jantje said
Brought white roses
Dear mom, sweet little sister here
Those are for you two <|endoftext|> 
Goodbye, I have to leave you
But I still remain faithful to you
Lucky that we sat together
Disappears way too soon for us
But one day the time will come again
That I see you again
Then our life dreams become
Another truth of poetry

Reminder will always remain, because
Your image keeps popping up in my mind
I will keep thinking, in that distant land
How good you have been to me

Goodbye, I have to leave you now
Even if it hurts
Because tears can't help now
Honey, goodbye, I won't forget you



It's such a shame, honey, we've got to get a divorce
I have to let you go so unexpectedly now
It's so painful and sad for both of us
That I have to leave you alone like that

Goodbye, I have to leave you
But I still remain faithful to you
Lucky that we sat together
Disappears way too soon for us
But one day the time will come again
That I see you again
Then our life dreams become
Another truth of poetry

Reminder will always remain, because
Your image keeps popping up in my mind
I will keep thinking, in that distant land
How good you have been to me

Goodbye, I have to leave you now
Even if it hurts
Because tears can't help now
Honey, goodbye, I won't forget you <|endoftext|> 
I like beautiful things
In the artistic field
From sculpture, music and painting
But however all this interests me
Yet it is claimed by me at all times

Much more beautiful than the most beautiful painting
Are you, my darling, are you
The shine of your hair and the blush on your face
The radiance of your eyes, more beautiful than the sunlight
I've seen the Mona Lisa too
That was a dream indeed
But more beautiful than this most beautiful painting
Are you, my darling, are you



I've seen the Mona Lisa too
That was a dream indeed
But more beautiful than this most beautiful painting
Are you, my darling, are you

Are you, my darling, are you <|endoftext|> 
I feel the peace, I feel free
Because I belong to you and you belong to me
Deep in your heart is where I stay
I feel the warmth around my slender body
If you make love to me
You strengthen my faith
In what I strive for
Do you know what you are giving?
It's for you that I'm alive
You breathe out, I breathe in
The source of life for this young man
And I thank the God above
Who views the world
Much closer to heaven
Since you love me
If you make love to me
You strengthen my faith
In what I strive for
Do you know what you are giving?
You give the feeling
Life has a purpose
When I'm aiming for you
Do you know what you are giving?
It's for you that I'm alive <|endoftext|> 
We often travel to foreign countries
And temporarily break all ties
For the emotion of the journey
We know a lot to tell
And can grind colorful images
From London, Rome or Paris
But let's compare
And watch everything sober
And we are not blinded by appearances
We often come to the conclusion
We look far for an illusion
Which you find so often nearby

refr .:
    Under the trees of the square
    You can be so happy there
    Under the roof of leafy greenery
    There at the gate of the park
    Under the trees of the square
    There is a small paradise there
    And from the bottom of my mind
    I send greetings from a distant land
    To you, my Rembrandtsplein



I am also here in faraway places
It is so strange to me, I search for words
To speak out what torments me
Often in mysterious nights
Then I sit alone in thought
While the past melts past me
I see reappearing in my mind
The spots that are now going to disappear
For the sake of city traffic
But leave some spots intact
To which much dear is connected
From beautiful hours of yesteryear

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Look at the sky Marleen
And listen to the wind
Don't look at the people
Because most people are bitter
And blinded

And I know what I want Marleen
I don't want to follow anyone anymore
Only the way of the wind
And the road
From the clouds

Because the world is around Marleen
We can go anywhere Marleen
The world is round
And we are not afraid
The world is forty thousand kilometers long

Our time stands still
Our story has been told
But we fear the great unknown
We are afraid of ourselves



And it's time to go
It is time to choose
It's time to let go of what you have
Then you don't have to lose

Because the world is around Marleen
We can go anywhere Marleen
The world is round
And we are not afraid
The world is forty thousand kilometers long

And it is never too late
Even if you are eighty-five years old
There is no excuse
So get your bags ready

Because the world is around Marleen
We can go anywhere Marleen
The world is round
And we are not afraid
The world is forty thousand kilometers long <|endoftext|> 
Over the years
I pretended
I forgot you
And you no longer existed
Now I am here for you
By chance at a party
Nailed to the ground
You have never been more beautiful

But perhaps
Is it too late
Perhaps
Are you right?
Perhaps
Have I talked too much
And is it better
Better shut up



Maybe you are right
And one day will come
But I don't want to be someone
Who waits for someone for life
I know every ship
Sooner or later it disappears
But we are through the gods anyway
Made for each other

Perhaps
Is it too late
Perhaps
Are you right?
Maybe I've talked too much
And is it better
Better shut up

Perhaps
Is it too late
Perhaps
Are you right?
Maybe I've talked too much
And is it better
Better shut up
Maybe I've talked too much
And is it better
Better shut up <|endoftext|> 
Too late
Out of bed
The day is almost over
Without me
And I should do something
I just brushed my teeth

refr .:
    But tomorrow
    Tomorrow
    I start from the beginning
    Tomorrow
    Tomorrow
    I start from the beginning

How many times
How often
I've already told myself this
But it is so delicious
About life
Just to live
And nothing else



refr.

But today
Do I still have an extension
Of execution
Only today
So tonight
One more time in the pub
To celebrate
And I'm not making it too late
Because

But tomorrow
Tomorrow
I start from the beginning
Tomorrow

Tomorrow
I start from the beginning
Tomorrow
Or the day after tomorrow
Or about, about, about, about, about, about, about, the day after tomorrow
Or next year <|endoftext|> 
They know everything better
they know so well
they sit in their seats
and they tell you how.

Make sure you learn a trade,
happiness that is for later,
but no one can help us
not even a psychiatrist.

No one can tell you what to do
no one can say what you feel.

Don't keep dreaming
there is not enough time.
They lie that they see black
with their quasi-certainty.



But my grandfather is a hundred
and he doubts every day.
Such a man deserves a statue
and flowers on his grave,
for he said, for he said to me:

No one can tell you what to do
no one can say what you feel.

The king, the baker, the dirty president,
the gendarmerie, the pimp, the man nobody knows,
the starlings, the sparrows, the great gannet,
the singer, the dreamer, the drummer of the band,

the fat, the thin, the small consumer,
the papa, the mama, the eternal talent,
the pasha, the emperor camped in a tent,
the tall, the short, the fat producer,

no one can tell you what to do
no one can say what you feel. <|endoftext|> 
The blue veins
Flows past her temples
Down
And disappear
Next to her eyes
In nothing

In company
Is she always a bit absent
She's so beautiful
When she thinks in silence
To something



I do not have a life
To share a life with
I am not ground
On which a future is built
Love so often follows
The way of the seasons
And the end
Most of the year is cold

This distance
Is so beautiful
And inexplicably
Nothing has been said yet
There is no blame yet
I leave no man's land
Rest in silence
And search the battlefield
In the words I write

But as words
Building bridges
Shall I be silent because
With a bridge
The myth disappears
From the other side <|endoftext|> 
My city has golden towers
My city has gray streets
My city is located along the Scheldt
Sleep at night
My town has red lips
And a diamond heart
They watch me for hours
She can shamelessly seduce me because

My city has beautiful legs
My city has bright eyes
My city has little to give
But she can promise so much
My city has a past
Which she never tells about
She is enchanted by love
And beat up by the money

But I love my city
I like my city
My city, my city, my heart

My city is hiding people
Without money, without property
In the godforsaken shacks
In the room with no light
Toothless women live there
Sent by melancholy
They have so much to tell
But no one can understand them



And the whores walk in my neighborhood
on the large Astridplein
They are close to the station
But they never take the train
I was born on every street
I know the way to every pub
Because I've been looking for myself here
From late evening to early morning

And I love my city
I like my city
My city, my city, my heart

My city, my city is soft
As soft as clear water
She is tender to a dreamer
She has a harbor for pirates
And my city, my city is hard
And insufferably arrogant
Because she hates, she hates a stranger
From a distant and poor country


But I love my city
I like my city
I like my city
I hate, I love my city
I like my city
I hate my city
I like my city
My heart <|endoftext|> 
Maria
She comes and sees and conquers
She comes and looks and she blinds
And what she is looking for is what she finds

Maria
Comes like a thief in the night
She breaks the code of your heart
She does it quickly and unexpectedly
She is heaven sent
She heals and anoints all wounds
She steals your heart
Maria

Maria
Knows all the loopholes
Knows every unwritten law
She knows so well what she's fighting for

Maria
It never goes unnoticed
She comes and sees and she conquers



She does a miracle and enchants
She comes and sees and conquers
She blinds

Maria
My, my, my Maria

She is heaven sent
She heals and anoints all wounds
She breaks your heart
Maria

And what she wants is what she gets
Because all the Gods are with her
Side by side

She is heaven sent
She heals and anoints all wounds
She steals your heart

I said, You may think you're the only one
Forget it
I said: You may think that you
here now the rules determined
I said, You may think that I am
just let you do it
You're wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong ...
And even if you are mom's new friend
That leaves me cold
Mommy is mine tomorrow
Mommy is mine tomorrow
From tomorrow mom will be mine
Mommy is mine tomorrow
This is the last night
May you sleep here
Because Mommy is mine tomorrow

He said: Come on pooh
I'm not taking your mama away from you, am I?
Mommy is mine tomorrow
But he looked so mean
And he said it with such a nasty laugh
Mommy is mine tomorrow
I said don't call me shit
Only my mother can do that
Woo, Woo, Woo, Woo, Woo ...
And you just tell me
And keep your decency

Mommy is mine tomorrow
Mommy is mine tomorrow
From tomorrow mom will be mine
Mommy is mine tomorrow
This is the last night
May you sleep here
Because Mommy is mine tomorrow
I said, I'll send the whole army
from the world towards you
Mommy is mine tomorrow
And my uncle who can do karate
and it knocks your stupid head off
Mommy is mine tomorrow
And my father's girlfriend who cooks you
in a very large pan
And then, and then, and then
Then we'll eat you and I'll search
another man though
for Mama



Mommy is mine tomorrow
Mommy is mine tomorrow
From tomorrow mom will be mine
Mommy is mine tomorrow
This is the last night
May you sleep here
Because Mommy is mine tomorrow
Mommy is mine tomorrow
Yes, Mommy is mine tomorrow
Mommy is mine tomorrow

Mommy is mine
I don't want to share her
But if you are nice
Then you can borrow her
But not for long
Because when I'm in bed
I always get scared
When Mom is gone again
When Mom is gone again
When Mom is gone again
When Mom is gone again
Oh mama

Mama will always be mine
Mama will always be mine

You can borrow her
To play with
But Mommy will always be mine <|endoftext|> 
Even though the sun always sets
Although the sky is not always blue
I keep believing in a miracle
With you
Although the world will keep turning
Even though the tide always turns
Just let me get lost here
And wait for what comes
Because suddenly you are standing in front of me again
And even though I may be dreaming this now
There is nothing, nothing in the world more beautiful
Then about you
Than to see you
Just use this song as an anchor
Or as a jacket against the cold
Because this is a song for no one else
For no one else but you
Because suddenly you are standing in front of me again
Even though I may be dreaming this
There is nothing more beautiful in the world
Then about you, then about you
Then for you, then to see you for me
This is a song for no one else
This is a song for no one else
This is a song for no one else
A song for nobody else
Then for you, then for you <|endoftext|> 
I believe in the woman who fights
Those against the tribulation
Keep looking for a way
I believe in the word
That is weighed in silence
I believe in the man
With the light in his eyes

And I'm on the side
From those in the dark
They are waiting for a day
They are waiting for a miracle
And I scream

refr .:
    I scream for every voice that is stifled
    I scream for every heart that gets broken
    I shout for those who are not heard there
    I scream for any woman who continues to believe

I saw a man's eyes
Who was buried alive
Who lived forty-two years in the dark
And at the end of the century
And at the end of his days
Saw the light and gave love
Which he never got

And I'm on the side
Of the truth that must be silent
Which is never heard
Who will never be proved right
And I scream

Let today be a day like any other
A Tuesday in an ordinary week
A day that will not make history
A day that everyone quickly forgets

Let today be a day like any other
A dull gray weekday
A Tuesday that made the newspapers go bankrupt
Because there is not much news to report

Let today be a day like any other
We pretend we are blind and demented
And let's forget what we know
That no one recognizes his enemies anymore
That no one recognizes his enemies anymore
Let today be a day like any other
There is no price higher than that of blood
And what do we care about the price of oil
We want to go cycling if we have to



Let today be a day like any other
As if war never existed
And send some astronauts to space
Instead of the whole world to the moon

Let today be a day like any other
Or turn the clock back billions of years
So that we again like monkeys without brains
The fleas scratch each other's backs
Turn the clock back billions of years

Let today be a day like any other
A Tuesday in an ordinary week
A day that will not make history
A day that everyone quickly forgets
A day that everyone quickly forgets <|endoftext|> 
His opinion was his fate
His words are fatal
He couldn't accept
That his life was determined
By tyrants and soldiers
With their lust for power and violence
In the country where he lived
It was all about the money

In the land of stone
In the land of stone
Where a people scream in pain
Of unbearable burdens
Where unwanted guests
Want to be separate
In the land of stone

A space with four walls
Bars in his window
They couldn't stop him
Continue to fight
All his dreams
About everything that has never been
One day it will come
One day there is life



Then everything is voluntary
Everything for everyone
Limits unnecessary
In the land of stone

In the land of stone
In the land of stone
Where a people scream
From the pain
Of unbearable burdens
Where unwanted guests
Want to be separate

In the land of stone
In the land of stone
Where a people scream
From the pain
Of unbearable burdens
Where unwanted guests
Want to be separate

In the land of stone
In the land of stone
Where a people scream
From the pain
Of unbearable burdens
Where unwanted guests

My father falls asleep
On the beach
The wind that blows
Through his newspaper
And reads
What has been
What has been said
She has no judgment
And she speaks
No right

My mother takes me
To the sea
Up to my knees
In the water
My father is lying
Still sleeping
And forget
What has been
What has been said
He has no judgment
And he speaks
No right



I see the white houses
Along the boulevard
For the Vuurbaak
State an artist
He paints and shakes
The world mixed up
And makes the lie
True

The wind that turns
The sailboat turns
And tackles
Against the current

From what has been
What has been said
He has no judgment
And he speaks
No right <|endoftext|>

     I saw a picture today
     From fifteen years ago
     We were in our senior year
     We were in Paris
     Jardin de Luxembourg
     You can see the parliament
     And somewhere in the distance
     A white pigeon flies past

The flowers are in bloom
It was probably spring
The sun is in the east
It's maybe ten o'clock
We stand side by side there
And some who sit
And in the distance stands
The white statue of Racine

It was the second day
If I remember correctly
We sang on the stairs at night
From the Sacre-Coeur
And we knew; next year
Then our ways part
But we all laugh
Small format in color

The undisputed leader
Is front and center
Smiling and provocative
Always the highest word
And always big plans
To change the world
It has been fifteen years now
I haven't heard of it again



And way past the last row
She said, she was shy
The silent outsider
Which was never noticed
I recently read
That she now as a nurse
Somewhere on the front line
Civil war works

And the thinker stands absently there
To stare at the sky
He's playing with a thought
About time and eternity
He had talent, was meant to be
To write a masterpiece
But the best go first
We are the foam that remains

I still remember how we got together
Almost every night
Looked at the colors
From the setting sun
We drank wine and sat
On the Place de la Concorde
And saw in the distance
An ark of triumph

Come on Jef
It's getting late
The night that falls
And it's cold here on the street
She's not coming back
You wait for nothing
It is too late

No, Jef
I'm not leaving
I'm staying with you
Forget about her
That fucking bitch
No, you are not alone
You know I'll stay with you

Come on Jef
We have to go
The whole neighborhood is already on the street
You shout them awake with her name
I'm ashamed here, come on
We go

We go
I still have enough money for mussels and wine
And when we are fed up we go to the pub
We drink ourselves until everything seems different
And the whole world becomes more beautiful

Then we go to the whores, princesses of the street
They see us as a king, as long as you pay, Jef
And early tomorrow morning we will take the train
To somewhere far from here, to where the women are different

We leave everything behind
We will never come back
Because forgetting, Jef, forgetting is happiness



Come on, Jef, we have to go
The world is waiting for you and me
She's not coming back
It is over
Past Jef for good

Yes, Jef, I know it too
You break your heart
Everything looks black
You prefer to die in the gutter
Better dead without her

But Jef it is also our own fault
You do not see your own wife
Until they go
Then it hurts
You pray and kneel and kiss her feet
Not for love
But only
Not to be alone
Come on
We go

We go
We move to the south, an island in the sun
Beyond the equator where winter never comes Jef
And at night before you sleep I play my guitar
Until you no longer dream of her

We pretend we are blind to what has been
We live like a god, we celebrate every night
And all those bitches here
We forget with beer
With vodka and with wine
Until the memory disappears

We leave everything behind
We will never come back
Because forget Jef
Forgetting is happiness

We will never come back <|endoftext|> 
I saw you sleeping
Next to me this morning
I woke up in a dream
Close your eyes and
The sun on your face
So fragile and
So indescribably beautiful
And I knew
You are for me
You are for me
What no one else could ever be

So let me live
In your dreams
Tell me what I read from your lips
All my past
I've forgotten it all
Everything that has been there for you
Because
You are for me
You are for me
What no one else could ever be



All the people
All their words
Everything revolves around feeling too little
Success, recognition
Anyone can have it
But you are my ambition
You are my goal
And I know
You are for me
You are for me
What no one else could ever be

I saw you sleeping
Next to me this morning
I woke up in a dream <|endoftext|> 
You, there in the dark
You, there in the night
You who look to the sky
And waiting for a miracle

You, there in the maze
And you, who are forgotten
You who search for the light
And want to break the chain



You don't just think
You don't just dream
You are not alone
Because we are on your side

You there, who keeps fighting
Against the mills in the wind
Who continues to believe in love
Against any current

You're not alone
You don't just dream
You are not alone
Because we are on your side <|endoftext|> 
It's written
That the world
In this city
Goes down
It's written
That death here
Lord and master is
On the street

I can hear the barking
Of the dogs
I see the bars
In front of the windows
Because the impotence
From hunger
Desperate
To the weapons

But I'm pretending
The danger does not exist
Because I'm walking with an angel
Through an unlit street
I'm pretending
The danger does not exist
Because I'm walking with an angel
Through an unlit street



It's written
That the turmoil
Of the rebellion
In the air
In this town here
Which is built
On a mountain
From diamond

It's written
That my life
Not worth much
When night falls
Like the streets
Be bird-free
Like the last light
Disappears

I see the bloodshot eyes
Of a child who was like a mutt
Come to me and ask for money
I see a country that always has everything
Wanted to leave with the old and that
Now the price pays <|endoftext|> 
We once played hide and seek

you can become anything

Familiar and strange all together

I have no intention of sharing my feelings
With those who are dear to me or who don't care
My days, my nights, my tears, my worries
I keep my deepest desires hidden

I have been cheated too many times in my life
I have been lied to too many times by my friends
So you really don't have to expect anything from me
I share my innermost thoughts
with nobody
with nobody
with nobody
with nobody

It's just things I don't want to express
They will not come out all my life
My innermost thoughts that hide inside
I don't want to capture that in words and sentences



But sometimes I wish I could share them
Showing myself and not having to play a role
And yet it is better to leave it that way
I just don't want to discuss it
with nobody
with nobody
with nobody
with nobody
with nobody
with nobody
with nobody

Well then don't share my life with anyone anymore
And whoever loves me, I don't care
I have food and drink and no wishes
I don't need anything anymore and certainly no people
ALTHOUGH I have a hard time with myself
Then I won't tell anyone
No, nobody ever has to expect anything
I don't share my innermost thoughts with anyone

than let you alone
you don't want to sell your freedom
so I have to let you go

you don't understand
what everything in this life is about
you avoid anything
because you don't know what you stand for

but go well
take your life
and live it up for a while
because I'm sure
It only takes a moment
and then you long again
then you long for us again

You don't have to explain to me
what a blind person sees
but that you didn't dare to say anything
I do not believe that
and don't tell me
that you love me
because you have your whole life
built around you



you don't understand
what everything in this life is about
you avoid anything
because you don't know what you stand for

but go well
take your life
and live it up for a while
because I'm sure
It only takes a moment
and then you long again
then you long for us again

... really doesn't believe in me
that our love has died out
in a month you will be home again ...

take your life
and live it up for a while
because I'm sure
It only takes a moment
and then you long again

ohoo <|endoftext|> 
I've been so blind all this time
Happiness was in the palm of my hand
But no matter how I would look at what you don't see, you don't see it
And with complete conviction, I put on my shoes to find even more happiness
Because my eyes have opened so hard (dweg) it became clear that I am only missing one thing
That everything is an illusion
That there is only one conclusion

I don't want another, I don't want another anymore because you and nobody else
No, nobody else belongs to me
I changed
I've changed from the man who keeps looking into a man who sees what is in front of him
And it may be too late
Is there someone else who makes you happy now?
But darling different, otherwise I offer myself here
And if you give me the chance, I'll never let you go

It's the difficulty of the possibilities
I went down in the sea of ​​plenty
I was distracted and arrogant
So that's what wealth does to me
Or I fell to Earth and I thought I was flying
I was going to lose everything because I couldn't choose
And the great thing about it all is that I was only cheating on myself
Because after the hard landing I'm standing here with empty hands, oh



I don't want another, I don't want another anymore because you and nobody else
No, nobody else belongs to me
I changed
I have changed from the man who keeps looking to the man who sees what is before him
And it may be too late
Is there someone else who makes you happy now?
But darling different, otherwise I offer myself here
And if you give me the chance, I'll never let you go

It's the difficulty of the possibilities
Happiness was in the palm of my hand
But now I see what I want
So baby give me one more chance
Eeh eeh
Eeh eeh eeh eeh
Eeh eeh

I changed
I've changed from the man who just stays
Search in the man who sees what is in front of him
And it may be too late
Is there someone else who makes you happy now?
But darling different, otherwise I offer myself here
And if you give me the chance, I'll never let you go. <|endoftext|> 
Nobody hears
When our song sounds again
How you sing it to me
In the chorus

When your hand very soft
Just take mine
Is that moment alone
Sensible to me

Nobody sees
Because you're not there
It's just my heart that tells me
That we are still together

And no one feels
What it does to me
I can not forget you
My heart doesn't want to know
That you left me
And whatever someone does or says
I close my eyes and deny



Because I believe
That you're still with me

Every memory
Every shadow of every moment
Oh, my heart only has to recognize something
And it is just real
Like you're still with me

And nobody knows
What else you do to me
I can not forget you
My heart doesn't want to know
That you left me forever
And whatever someone does or says
I close my eyes and deny
Because I believe
Because I believe

Because I can see and hear you
Can smell can taste
I feel you every moment

Because I believe
That you're still with me <|endoftext|> 
The night turns gray
The day is dawning
The wind that blows
I hear your name
And slowly I come to
I miss you
Do you miss me

Daylight screams
I am numb
A whirlwind is raging through my head
Still it is quiet next to me
I miss you
Do you miss me

And I don't know what I'm saying
And I don't know what I'm doing
I don't know which way
And I don't know where to go
I miss you
I miss you

I see you in a dream before me
There is someone else on your side
And slowly the image breaks in me
I miss you
Do you miss me



A new day
And everything falls apart
I lie and wait
Until no one comes
I wait
Until no one comes

I miss you

And I don't know what I'm saying
And I don't know what I'm doing
I don't know which way
And I don't know where to go
I miss you
I miss you

You should only know how ... much <|endoftext|> 
I take off my mask for you
I'm not playing with you
You can see me as I am
but it does scare me

I take off my mask for you
and hope you see then
I'm just a joker
who laughs at his grief

I take off my mask for you
I have no more walls
because you are just as vulnerable
I put down my weapons

I take off my mask for you
I reveal myself to you
I cast my heart and soul
out of love in your womb



Because nobody needs to know
how fragile and how small
how anxious and shy
I can be now and then

My strength and my weakness
you get them both
I want to share them with you
do you want that with me too

Not a lie to protect
with people like you
You have never seen my mask
You only saw me <|endoftext|> 
through destroyed streets, without a father without a country
you walk helplessly at your mother's warm hand
like a sheep among wolves
the destination unknown
and no one sees how small you are
no one sees how small you are



tomorrow it will be peace
the sun will caress you
the world will be a playground again
and you can play quietly

after winter comes spring
the gray sky turns blue again
but even if you are out of the war
will the war ever get out of you?
beautiful eyes are poisoned
are used to the violence
and no one sees how small you are
no one sees how small you are <|endoftext|> 
Marco:

She hears her son's crying
Grabs the baby in her lap
He is hungry because there was no water and no bread today
This was not like in her dreams
and they weren't even big
Yet she feels happiness inside
when she comforts her little
With her voice she takes him away from his hunger for a moment
without words, said quietly

Middle piece:
Aaahh aahh ahhhh

Sometimes I get lost somewhere in time
Have I lost the overall meaning of life for a while
And especially with all those people around me
Then I feel alone, a bit more alone

But then I hear the music and it lifts me up
She drowns out all the sounds of the doubts in my head
And I know whatever will happen
if I stumble or I fall, that I will be right again

Because I always have my music!

He runs his hands through her hair
And he breaks from her grief
He wants to comfort his daughter so badly but his words don't reach



Why did it have to happen
His wife wasn't too young
Then he remembers the song she sang to their girl
And both, they drift away from their tears for a moment
To the sounds she knows

Middle piece:
Aaahh aahh ahhhh

Ali b:
It brings people together and it speaks all languages
It gives us motivation when we are afraid of failure
It makes us stray, when our thoughts are raging
But in another phase it actually brings us into ecstasy

Now is the time to chill
Now is the time to let go
Music helps me to be quiet
Music helps me get up again
So when I'm in trouble I don't bother
I know that I will overcome

Because I always have my music!

Bag2Bank:
Yes throw those hands up
Because you are too cool
And stamp those feet on the floor if you feel these
Zero your mind, nothing is mandatory, anything is allowed
Push with those hands, because the roof is coming off!

I always have my music!
I always have my music! <|endoftext|> 
A voice speaks in the distance
Which I recognize from our arguments
About minor misunderstandings
About great disillusions!

And I hear the chilly sounds
From your restrained anger
But what can I do more than cry
If I couldn't suspect this

In a blur I hear you say
That you want to give up everything
That you take everything with you
What is dear to me in this life

And I listen to your words
Slowly get into the senses
That hit me like lightning
With destructive power

This chill drives me crazy
And this feeling is terrifying
But your words grind on
And my eyes look questioning



Why didn't you tell me before
That you were so alienated from me
WHY DO YOU TALK ABOUT LOVE
IF YOU NEVER LOVED ME

I lose it in despair
And I can feel my tears burning
And I would like nothing more
Then put my head back in your hands

But what until an hour ago
Still seemed so safe
Is a very big lie
And turned out to be a house of cards

It's like someone else
Has crawled into your body
And I didn't even notice
That it has crept in

To erase your love
And destroy my world
Nobody wants to tell me
That I have ... dreamed everything <|endoftext|> 
I should run really fast
But I can't
I'm nailed to the ground
There is something inexplicable about you
Which makes me defenseless
I seem to have been frozen by the sun

I hear myself screaming
But I'm not listening
I am going against my better judgment
The course has already been determined
By something much bigger than myself
I give my ending a start

I try to resist
But that makes no sense at all

Because when I look at you
When I think of you
Every thought of you
Is too much for me
Every second
That I give to you
I feed the need for you
You come closer
You master me

Here I am
Chained to that look of yours
No rope or chain is involved
You don't need high walls
To keep me from going
Because my will is no longer the will that I had



I try to resist
But that makes no sense at all

Because when I look at you
When I think of you
Every thought of you
Is too much for me
Every second
That I give to you
I feed the need for you
You come closer
You master me

In one more frantic attempt
To get out of here in one piece
I ran as fast as I could
Through mountains and valleys
Along forests and rivers
But I couldn't resist
I looked back for a moment
And now I have finished again
Where it all started

Because when I look at you
Every thought of you
Is too much for me
Every second
That I give to you
I feed the need for you
You come closer
You master me

Master of mine
Take control of me. <|endoftext|> 
How do you fall asleep
How does your day start
Do you open your eyes with a tear or a smile
And look around you
And do you see the sun
Or are you looking for the shadow on the ground behind everything?
And you live for happiness
Or do you die of grief
And that feels like a choice
Or you don't have that choice
It doesn't really matter
Whether that's the truth or not
It's how you see it

How beautiful
Can be life
It depends on how you look
It's just what you dream
How beautiful
Is your reality
You are just as rich
As rich as you feel



You know what you have
The circle is complete
You see what it says
Or are you just missing what it said
You get what you want
Or even more than what you asked for
Are you satisfied with the least
Or most of it is not enough
You will be amazed by the snow
From the rustling of the wind
Do you enjoy the birds
Of the laughter of a child
You create your happiness
What within yourself
Where it ends and begins

How beautiful
Can be life
It depends on how you look
It's just what you dream
How beautiful
Is your reality
You are just as rich
As rich as you feel
As rich as you feel

How beautiful
Can be life
It depends on how you look
It's just what you dream
How beautiful

Oh you, I thought you knew better
I thought you were better than that
Oh you are so naive and so lost
So in love, over your ears, and he
No honey, he doesn't mean it to you
And he is not worth it
What he says to you, he says to her at home
But he's never going to kiss you in public
So you have to find out for yourself, darling, but

What do you want to be
Someone's lover or his greatest secret?
And do you free yourself? (Do you free yourself from him or?)
Or do you choose someone who will never really be there for you?
And ask yourself the question
Are you not worth much more
Than the lipstick on his collar?

Because I can see it on his collar, honey
But you are worth a lot more than that
I can see it on his collar, honey
But you are worth a lot more than that

Yeah, his ring on the cupboard next to your bed
While he washes all your scent off his body
And you also know that the ring is on his finger again
And that it then disappears from your life
That he won't text your days and miss your calls
That he erased your number and messages from his life
Can you live with that knowledge?
Can you live in that light?
Honey, you know this isn't it, right?



What do you want to be
Someone's lover or his greatest secret?
Do you want the pain? (Do you want the pain from him?)
Or are you waiting for someone who will really be there for you?
And ask yourself the question
Are you not worth much more
Than the lipstick on his collar?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
The lipstick on his collar
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

The lipstick on his collar, honey
But you are worth a lot more than that
I can see it on his collar, honey
But you are worth a lot more than that

The lipstick on his collar, baby (what do you wanna be?)
Because you are worth a lot more than that
Yes, I would be there for you, honey
Because you are worth a lot more than the lipstick on his collar <|endoftext|> 
The spring sun is shining
She spreads her wings
The birds are getting closer
But you don't hear a sound

Caught in silence
Will this ever pass
You don't see the new life
You only feel the pain

The trees release their blossom
The scent that is spread
You don't do much
Spring snow
You see spring snow

You look upwards
You wonder why
You haven't seen light for far too long
Even though the sun is shining



The trees release their blossom
The scent that is spread
You don't do much
Spring snow
You see spring snow

In one second
Sunlight came through the clouds

One second with you is better than
An eternity alone

I was afraid to love
And my heart has stopped
But with your arms around my waist
Can I take on the world

Dancing on the stars
Four seasons in one night
This is one second
Be free of gravity
Walk on the water
Seeing sunlight before dawn
Flying without wings
All because of you

You reveal your secrets to me
it's all I wanted to hear



They were safe with me
But I effortlessly share them with you

My thoughts and my dreams
Are only aimed at you
I jump into the deep laughing
With my eyes closed

Dancing on the stars
Four seasons in one night
This is one second
Be free of gravity
Walk on the water
Seeing sunlight before dawn
Flying without wings
All because of you

refr .:
   No one leaves their own child alone
   You prefer to build a wall around her
   You want to preserve her youth so badly
   And save her a lot of grief
   No one leaves their own child alone

You always wanted to be next to me
You have done an awful lot for me
You gave me what you promised
A life I believed in
You always wanted to be next to me



refr.

What I found with you and still find
That, I now transfer to my child
Nothing will ever erase that image
She should never miss my love
You do everything, everything for your child

No one leaves their own child alone (Thanks dad)
You prefer to build a wall around her (Nice feeling that was)
You want to preserve her youth so badly
And save her a lot of grief
No one leaves their own child alone <|endoftext|> 
You already sleep my son but this
Means a lot to me
And I'll tell you
Before it could be too late
Your mother and me
Don't care about each other anymore
Heaven knows what I do
She had to take it

refr .:
    I only have you my son
    I see myself in you my son
    And if I stay, I'll only be my son for you

Maybe you wonder
Why we ever started
Two strangers to each other
Full of hatred and pain
I so hope you
Never make a mistake
That beauty is love
That never really touches the heart



refr.

Fortunately you don't hear anything
From what I'm telling now
If you suffer from it
Is that a second hell
Just sleep on
And dream until early tomorrow
That life is harder
You will learn that soon enough

refr. (2x)

For you my son <|endoftext|> 
My life is a song

This is my life, this is my life
I don't want to live otherwise.
This is my life, this is my life
Because my life is a song.

Sung, played with a laugh or a tear,
From torre di Pisa to the West of the Jordan.

That's my life, that's my life
Because my life is a song.

Will I ever be born a second time
Then never let it be different for me.
'Cause I've lost all my heart
To that life as a happy chorus.

This is my life, this is my life
I don't want to live otherwise.
This is my life, this is my life
Because my life is a song.



Sung, played with a laugh or a tear,

Mother how can I thank you
For everything you did
None other than you
Was so good to me
In joy and in sorrow



refr .:
    Mother you stay in my life
    The woman I love most
    Because everything I know now
    And all that I am now
    Mother I owe that to you

You have me in life
Always given love
You were just thinking about me
You have without complaining
Behave my worries
Not one was as good as you

I'd like to be in the land of fairytales
That's where dreams come true
Everything is clean in the land of fairy tales
One only lives for each other

refr.
    I have a very nice fairytale book
    With that I often spend hours searching
    I then read how good always conquers evil
    Well, all fairytales were real
    Then life was not bad for a long time
    But who still believes in fairytales
    That's just a kid



For all people, be it big or small
I have some good advice
Should your wishes be unfulfilled
Then fairy tales benefit

refr. <|endoftext|> 
It really says the sentence:
Every ending is a new beginning
Love always wins

It seems the same day
Like when I woke up yesterday and you were next to me
It's the same bed, but it's cold

And I don't feel anything anymore
And I don't see anything anymore
Because there is nothing left
Around me
I'm just alone

Under the same sun
Who told us for years that the day began
The same warm wind, but without you

And I don't feel anything anymore
And I don't see anything anymore
Because there is nothing left
Around me

This moment and you are here
I'll see you in a second
I blink my eyes once and you're gone, stay away, forever



Eeeh

do not leave me alone
Because I don't feel anything without you
Without your arms and your love around me
I can not do it alone

No
I don't want it alone

No
It cannot be true, be so over, so suddenly gone for good

Ooooh

And I don't want anything around me anymore

I wrote it myself, the sentence: Every ending is a new beginning and love always wins <|endoftext|> 
(Willy & Willeke Alberti)

refr .:
    Laugh, cry a little
    I don't want to trade with anyone
    Because it is the life that I live
    You give it all your time
    I just want to keep going
    Only because I care about that life

When you are small you want to be big
And later you want to be young
You always want to be what you are not
A bit older and a bit wiser
Your hair will turn gray
You will find out who you are

Think to yourself
Done is done
And just hold on
What went well



Take a little, give a little
Yes that's life
And you notice something like that again and again
It must have been said many times
What you give must be real
Then you get a little bit more every day

refr.

Think to yourself
Done is done
And just hold on
What went well

Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalalalala
Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalalalala

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Yes I had
Fortuna in my path
I was lucky
Until this day
Success is nice
But cannot be everything
What really matters
Is the source from which everything arises

refr .:
    Love, small, but what a word
    Love is what belongs to us humans
    He who lives
    And still has a heart for a fellow human being
    He knows the wealth that gives love



It's over
What fate brings to me
Prosperity remains on my side
I sometimes wonder
I remain an optimist
The future decides
However it goes further
There is something I rely on

refr.

He who lives
And still has a heart for a fellow human being
He knows the wealth that gives love <|endoftext|>

Say do you remember about Kobie
Who always came cycling by
And always waved, yes she did
We hoped every time
But in a bit windy weather
Because Kobie had legs that could be there
I thought she was great
Yes just a wild rose
I thought she was more of a wild orchid
But whatever you wanted to call her
Oh we were both out in the cold
Because Kobie said to everything: no, no, no

refr .:
    Because Kobie had cures
    That was sad for us
    But Kobie saw nothing
    In an upcoming artist
    And that's why Kobie took
    Not you and not me either
    But she took a guy
    With a beef
    With a beef
    But she took a guy
    With a beef and pork butcher shop



Recently we were at Kobie's
We were in her shop
I bought a sausage
And I two blind finches
We took a look at her
And then to each other
And then quickly went for a drink together
I looked a little blank
I did not see a wild rose
My wild orchid looked like nothing
Because when you see her passing by
Then there is nothing special about that
Just a fat lady on a bicycle

refr.

And that's why Kobie took
Not you and not me either
But she took a guy
With a beef
With a beef
But she took a guy
With a beef and pork butcher shop <|endoftext|> 
The storm is howling out there
Lands the white snowy nature
Behind frozen white windows
Sit one each by the crackling fire of the hearth
And the children happily sing their songs
Around the Christmas tree, full of glittering light
And the most beautiful church melodies
Are devoutly raised up to heaven

Silent night, holy night
Today the Christmas child was born
Shepherds, gentle, keep watch
Baby from Bethlehem, slumber, sleep tight

Bibb'rend walks along the streets
a poor beggar still around;
All the roads are deserted
No one ventures outside, not even a dog;
Cold snow penetrates his puncture clogs
It is neither wet nor dry in its hollow stomach
And the bleak wind cuts through his rags
Big tears sparkled in his eye



Silent night, holy night
He raises himself pleadingly to heaven
And then shyly asks: God let me now
Celebrate Christmas with the angels with you

Hungry, exhausted from suffering
He falls on a sidewalk
And he hears the children happy
Sing to the Lord in the Christmas carol
His frozen hands folded piously
He falls asleep and God answers him there
When we see the body early in the morning
He celebrates Christmas in the Eng'lenschaar

Silent night, holy night
Gloria in Excelsis Deo,
't Schooiertje small, will be full of fun
Be forever above with the Christmas child <|endoftext|> 
Look at me one more time
Before we part ways
Look one more time in the eye
Who never cheated on you
Look at me one more time
Before I have to give you up
Although this separation cannot be avoided
Look at me one more time



For years we shared joy and sorrow
Then fate came so heartlessly cruel
Well I have to say goodbye to you
I know how much I love you

Look at me one more time
Before we part ways
Look one more time in the eye
Who never cheated on you
Look at me one more time
Before I have to give you up
Although this separation cannot be avoided
Look at me one more time <|endoftext|> 
When I was a boy of barely eighteen years old
Of course I was always ready for fun
And goes without saying, I went
Also to the singing association
Because you were very nice together there
And I sang tenor there with the most fire
Or rather let me say, it continued before that
But that was not the main point
Because even under the most beautiful song
I always watched a girl from the choir
And then I came into her favor
Like a brother in art
But when my voice stopped working
I got my congé very quickly

Still, I still love my first one
My first girl from the singing club
My sweetest little soprano
With which I walked in the lane
But who no longer thinks of me
Now that I don't sing anymore

When my voice was worn out and I stopped singing
And another singer pushed me out of her favor
I had to get used to my grief
Met other girls
Whose favor I threw with renewed anger
But no matter how beautiful, how sweet they have been at times
A memory always floated before my mind
And I heard in my ear
The soprano from the choir
That was my first great love
If I had an adventure
And one girl loved it
When I looked into her eye
And my soul flew to heaven



Still, I kept thinking about my first
My first girl from the singing club
My sweetest little soprano
Which I walked with in the lane
But who no longer thinks of me
Now that I don't sing anymore

If I marry someone else later
And then hold a decent wedding reception
With black coat and long and short
Uncles and aunts, white port
I see with a slight melancholy towards my wife
When I stand in front of the altar in church
And go over the long runner in arms
And people are looking forward
To the bridegroom and the bride
And the friends are watching us
And they sing unseen
Bridal choir from the Lohengrin
And I stand there and I hear
The sopranos of the choir

Then I sometimes think about my first
My first girl from the singing club
My sweetest little soprano
With which I walked in the moon
But who no longer thinks of me
Now that I don't sing anymore <|endoftext|> 
Land of chaos and beauty
Land of beer and conniving
Land of days long gone
Land of fighters on cobblestones

Land of chips and boules
Land of life behind shutters
Land of people who say something
With the art of dodging

I like seeing you

Land of restrained anger
Land of utter silence
Land of ugliness that is beautiful
Country of languages ​​that differ



Land of pubs, cathedrals
Land of unparalleled women
Land of gray villages, crazy morning
I will always love you

I like seeing you

This love song is unapproachable
Because I love you just the way you are
With all your pros and all your cons
No one has ever tamed you

Country that can embrace
Land that can disown
Country to leave
Land to come back
Country where I will always be a stranger
Land that I will never really understand

But I would love to see you <|endoftext|> 
I'm singing this song for you alone
So that you will understand me
I'm singing this song for you alone
For no one but you
The stars twinkle in the sky
The night is wonderful, so quiet
A sultry wind blows like a sigh
It's as if the world wants to rest
Now is the time when I have to say something
Only for you
I just hope you do the same
I will never be anything but happy with you
I'm singing this song for you alone
For no one but you
I whisper softly to me
I love you, only you

Now is the time when I have to say something
Only for you
I just hope you do the same
I will never be anything but happy with you
I'm singing this song for you alone
Not for anyone but you
I whisper softly to me
I love you, only you <|endoftext|>

I'm just an ordinary twink
All my cables have a hitch
One does not fall on all my lots
But I have you, my fine chick

I am certainly not a fascinating piece
My feet are a bit difficult
I hardly ever get what I asked for
But I got you, and that's enough



You and me
Me and you
You belong with me
Like May at spring
Like rice with currants
Like Chrolis (?) With dandruff
You belong with me
As will with bommel
(???) with junk
When Sam is with Moos
I belong with you
As a plant at sundown
Saint at little chap
Like mad at heart
I never get caught
It will always be you and me
You belong with me

You don't look like a mannequin like that
Who just doesn't have what should be there
The fact is, you're not a shoe
But you're Sjaan, my own chick

You don't have much of an advertising laugh
With teeth white as sprinkles
You don't put gunk in your hair
But nobody can break us up

You and me
Me and you
You belong with me
As a cop by whistle
Lit at jumeautje
If (??)
You belong with me
As a bowl of trouble
Noise at moped
Like Doris at Day
You belong with me
As salmon with salad
Psycho with daddy
Like Danny with Kay
I never get caught
It will always be you and me
You belong with me <|endoftext|> 
It was an evening in May
And you smiled so happy
't Maantje, that seemed
And I looked into your eyes
And you said very softly then
In that wonderful night
Sweet words to me
And you said



I love you
O love, yes only you
I keep seeing you in my dreams
The sky was blue
When I saw you
And then luck came for me
Yes, love you, yes you alone
I keep seeing you in my dreams
Luck has the two of us
Brought to name
And I always think about you
Day and night

Yes, love you, yes you alone
I keep seeing you in my dreams
Luck has the two of us
Brought to name
And I always think about you
Day and night <|endoftext|>

    Juliana thanks for more than thirty years
    For the time you gave, for the people of the Netherlands
    Juliana, thank you, even if you got silver hair
    Your heart remained gold, surrounded by diamonds

We really couldn't believe it
It was about five to eight
Programs were shifted
Who would have despised such a thing
Of course, it had to happen
But why so quickly
It made our blood flow faster
A majesty bids us farewell

Juliana thanks for all those wonderful years
For the time you gave, for the people of the Netherlands
Thank you Juliana, it was as if we were friends
That is why there was a close relationship between us



refr.

We will not soon forget you
How can we with such a woman
But one thing you should know
Because April thirty is coming very soon
We always want orange again
Four centuries is not nothing
A regal home without frills
Juliana now becomes Beatrix

Juliana, thank you, even if you got silver hair
Your heart remained gold, surrounded by diamonds <|endoftext|>

    I close my eyes and I see you
    You were the most beautiful woman to me
    Why did you leave now
    Believe me when I say
    That I still love you very much



Still, I will wait
Days and nights
And keep hoping
Because I can't forget you
When I hear your voice
Am I lost
What I feel with you
That's life for me

I want to learn Italian
Because you know, my dear dad
Every Italian boy follows me
Un momento, piano, piano
You will start very quickly
If you want to get married, va bene
But don't run too fast

Yes, that boy said that too
(???) ma ditte bon giorno
And I was immediately off the boil

He spoke of amore all the time
And he kissed me presto
Then he told me
Io t'amo, pianissimo
Well I already got it
You must learn Italian
You will sing "reflection" once
In Neapolitan

Non e difficele parlaro d'Italiano
And I answered "si si"
Non e difficele parlaro d'Italiano

In the sixties
I heard a voice
He didn't come from heaven
He didn't come from hell

So many beautiful words
And I didn't know who it was
That voice came from a box on the cupboard

My mother said "that's the radio"
I thought that's a miracle
And I can't live without it anymore
That miracle

refr .:
    I like the radio
    I like the radio
    I like the radio, radio, radio

I never watch TV again lately
All those stupid games
What do you do with that



Just give me the illusion
From a woman I don't know
I hear her voice only for me
I think about the rest

refr.

I wake up in the morning
With a voice that embraces me
And in the evening I go to sleep
With a voice that warms me

I prefer to see the world
With my eyes closed
And the ideal love is the love that makes no commitment
So

refr. <|endoftext|> 
The sun settles down
In the arms of the sea
The night chases the day
On the run
And the birds are silent when the light disappears
You can only hear the crickets

And I don't think about anything
I'm not thinking about anything
I only think about you



You can think of money
You can think of gold
You can think of the years that passed by
Thinking of dreams that fall and arise
And search in your mind for the great Why
But

I'm not thinking about anything
I'm not thinking about anything
I only think about you <|endoftext|> 
I know the Ten Commandments
I love my neighbors
As much as I can
And that is not that much

I have no conviction
Not a word I live by
Never believed anyone
Who knows the answer

Strange in this world
Strange these days
Everything passes
There is nothing that remains

Little is of value
Nothing matters
Almost everything I see
Born of fear

But I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
You are the ground on which I build
I believe in you

I know the Ten Commandments
I love my neighbors
As much as I can
And that is not that much



Strange in this world
Strange these days
Everything passes
There is nothing that remains

I have no conviction
Not a word I live by
Never believed anyone
Who knows the answer

Little is of value
Nothing matters
Almost everything I see
Born of fear

But I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
You are the ground on which I build
I believe in you

I will survive
As long as you stand next to me
I will survive
As best as it can be
Between woman and man

I surrender to you
I put down my weapons
Because the storm has died down
And the tide has turned
The tide has turned

And I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
You are the ground on which I build
I believe in you <|endoftext|> 
I am weeds, I do not perish
I always come back
I am a plague to those who hate me
And I wish you all the best of luck
I've learned to survive
Even though I will also break down tomorrow
They can dance on my grave
Because the day after tomorrow I get up
I existed and I exist
I will continue to exist
I existed and I exist
I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
I will continue to exist

Dead in love
Then kissed by happiness
That's how I went from heaven to hell
Back and forth, and back again
Finished and honored
Vomited and overtaken
Like a king on a donkey
And it hasn't done much yet
Because I existed and I exist
I will continue to exist
I existed and I exist
I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
I will continue to exist



But sometimes I have lost the north
Empty and tired, and on the run
Then it seems to me, the end seems near to me
But I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming
I always come back

Because, I was born for life
I was made for happiness, and if I have to
Waiting a thousand years
I have time, I have patience
Whoever keeps me silent keeps me alive
And who is blunt keeps me sharp
I defend every enemy
Because whoever is open is strong
And I existed and I exist
I will continue to exist
I existed and I exist
I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
I existed and I exist
I will continue to exist
I existed and I exist
I stay, I stay, I stay, I stay
I stay, I keep existing <|endoftext|> 
Hilton Barcelona
Eleven o'clock in the evening
A very successful businessman
Sit all alone
He's here on a purse
Meetings all day
And now he looks out of boredom
Going around aimlessly

His eyes wander, wander
To a lady in the hall
She sits alone, she is one of the luxury horses
From a Spanish whorehouse
And she gives you the illusion
That she allows herself to be seduced
It is not cheap but you can afford it
With a good credit card

First he still plays innocence
He introduces himself
Until he gets into alcohol
His innocence killed
He asks her her name
She only mentions a price
Suddenly it pulls in a faint flash
His wife passed him by

Then all his brains go down
Half a meter lower
He knows himself to his room door
Can still be worn neatly
But then he pulls horny
All clothes off her body
He comes after five minutes
She goes, and he, he stays

He stares at the ceiling
The tension is broken
He closes his eyes
He sees that slut everywhere
And then comes the guilt
Sneaked into his room
But for salvation lies the Bible
In four languages ​​next to his bed

Hilton Barcelona
Slowly it becomes light
Five stars off shit
He no longer sleeps a wink
The Spanish night is quiet
There is nothing in the air
Who always wants to move forward
Loses the way back



The nostalgia for times gone by
Rooms on the Place Pigalle
Half a star, a creaky bed
And the toilets in the hall
But a life without worries
A dream that still exists
And a love, so much love
Which you pay with a kiss

God, he had so many ideals
And he slept under the stars
He told everything he felt
Because he had nothing to hide
His fantasy was a palace
He had a head to live in
And he talked about later
Because the best was yet to come

Hilton Barcelona
Ten o'clock in the morning
He's having breakfast, sees himself
And feels the urge to puke
He wants to get out of here, back home
It's a choas in his head
Because this hotel is the home
Where homesickness lives

This hotel is the home
Where homesickness lives

See them walking here those men
Colorless between cold and warm
With their heavy briefcases
With their soul under their arm

In this hotel the lie reigns
Here tenderness has been dethroned
Because this hotel is the home
Where homesickness lives <|endoftext|> 
I've been drinking with
With death to life
Sank together until
The morning came
I said you still need me
Give about thirty years
To say
What I can't say now

I have been drinking
With death to life
I have listened
To an endless story
I was alone and around me
I saw those
Not that anymore
Could stand on their feet

I saw a woman
Absorbed in thought
With the last last round
In her hand
And with the spilled tracks
From maskara
Around the eyes
Where the fire no longer burns

And she has been drinking
She has been drinking
She has been drinking
She has been drinking



I saw a man's eyes
Who thought of a woman
Which he through his own fault
Has been lost
Because of the stupid desire
Towards a freedom
What he knows now
That it doesn't exist

And he has been drinking
He has drunk
He has drunk
He has drunk

The woman got up
She put on her coat
The man was shaky
Past us
Death asked him
Can I help
Then he looked back
To me and said

These are today
My last customers
It is already getting light
So I have to go
It was a pleasant evening
.... We see eachother
So
In thirty years
I saw them go

And I've been drinking
I have been drinking
I have been drinking
I have been drinking
I have been drinking
I've been drinking (On life)
I've been drinking (On life)
I've been drinking (Long live life)
I've been drinking (Long live life) <|endoftext|> 
I see countries tearing apart
I feel the cancer of cynicism
I see people without dreams
They flee in cheap luxury
And in the disaffected cities
Hate runs through old streets
The threat is getting closer
But I
I have a medicine

I love you
I prefer you
Better than my life
Then anything
I love you
I prefer you
I'd rather have you dear
Every day



Whatever I want to say
You get my words small
If only I were a poet
Then I could be closer to you
If only I were your blood
That flows through your body
Then I slept in your heart
And lived in your head

Because I love you
I prefer you
Better than my life
Then anything
I love you
I prefer you
Prefer dear
Every day <|endoftext|> 
Just give me the last lap
I've seen it here
For today
I know everyone here
In this godforsaken pub
And I see to everyone
How I got stuck myself

So give me one last lap
I don't want to know where I live tonight
I'm afraid of the dark
I'm afraid to go to sleep
Because I've had the same dream for years



refr .:
    Hold me
    Hold me
    Don't let me go down
    Hold me
    Hold me
    Let me stand in your shadow

I threw the keys to my car in the canal
Not a dog waiting for me, so where do I go
I have no more money to pay one last round
I'll die if you don't care about me

I am a dog
Those without a house, without a fireplace
Roams through town and country

I am a dog
I am not trained
I am armed to the tooth

I am a dog
A dog from the street
A bastard without a name
I am free to come and go as I please
I let myself out late at night
Because I'm not a beaten dog
And I am not a good dog
I am a dog that does not eat human beings
Because I don't bark, but I bite
I bite

I am a dog
Who is avoided like the plague by the rest
Because I am not satisfied with a loft, a boss and a bot
Once were the hunters, once we were the wolves
We are not made to follow anyone



So I am not a good dog
And I am not a beaten dog
I am a dog that does not eat human beings
Because I don't bark, but I bite
I bite

You're the bitch
As long as I live
Are you a bitch
Every dog ​​in heat was chasing your butt
You didn't think about me, you let them do their thing
You're a bitch
A bitch in heat
I don't care about anymore

So go to another one, a German bouvier
A golden retriever, I don't mind
Because I'm not a beaten dog
And I am not a good dog
I am a dog that does not eat human beings
Because I don't bark, but I bite
I bite

I am a dog
I am a dog <|endoftext|> 
The train left here
Here on this platform
Here the people stood
With fear in their eyes
Before the journey began

A man with a woman
A woman with a child
A child with a future
People
Hunted like animals

There was the east
They went there
Farther than a train can travel
To heaven
Through hell



Here was life
There was death
For every bastard and gypsy
For every homosexual
Any Jew

And I cannot understand
My head can't reach it
I can not understand
My head can't reach it

Too much has been written about it
And of course it was way too long ago
So we can do it, we can forget it
But if we forget
It starts again <|endoftext|> 
Love is bearable
Decided by her hands
But thoughts flow
Until streams that get bogged down

And the days that fade away
And times pass
The feeling creeps over me
Caught to be free

I feel the desire
I feel the desire
I feel, I feel the desire
To be free

But freedom is lost
In a sea of ​​solitude
Desire is cheated
Looking for Eternity



And her eyes are oppressive
Printed in the memory
How can people live
With the pain of happiness

I feel the desire
I feel the desire
I feel, I feel the desire
To be free

The wind shook the days
Who have gone with her
Yet love is bearable
But the freedom
But freedom is lost

I feel the desire
I feel the desire
I feel the desire to be free
The desire to be free <|endoftext|> 
I fell softly
Ended up well
Gravity finally has
Possessed me

And I feel the solid ground
I no longer long for the past
I know what I want to fight for
And who will keep me

It's good to be here



So let the ships leave now
This port gives confidence
Gives me ground to build on
So friends
I'll get by here

Because it is good to be here
It's good to be here

The sun gave us light
The moon showed us
That the sky can fall
That the water can burn
And that the world is changing
For those who want to see it

And it is good to be here
It's good to be here <|endoftext|> 
The hands of the clock
Stand ninety degrees
I'm in a square
To stare in front of me
I see a dead poet
A statue of steel
He's in the shade
From the cathedral

I'm sitting on a couch
And I'm talking to a blind man
For what I see
To find an answer



A forty year old man
Comes from somewhere
Walks across the square
And sees his daughter
She is now sixteen so he is
Silences and disappears
Because she is doing her best
To be another

And I'm sitting on a couch
And I'm talking to a blind man
For what I see
To find an answer

I see a woman with high heels
And a fox fur coat
She has everything from a predator
But she won't let go of the beast
I see two lovers
As a bright spot on the square
Intertwined
I would like to be someone else <|endoftext|> 
Maybe the sun was shining in my eyes
Maybe lightning struck
Perhaps it is true that love dazzles

Because you stood before my eyes, Ginette
And I saw happiness
Everything around me dissolved into the air

You don't know what I'm feeling, Ginette
And I don't know what you think
And perhaps this is the best moment

Not a word has been said
Not a word has been broken
I stand here and look at the light in your eyes

And I shut up, Ginette, I shut up
In order not to betray myself
But in my mind I shout your name from the rooftops



Ginette
Ginette
Ginette

Another cigarette and I know
It's a kind of flight
It's bad for my lungs but good for my rest

Because you blow through my head
And you run through my heart
And the world is more beautiful, Ginette ... than I thought

I walk around town
I look around
Everything is different
And the stones of the street
Adore me

And I dance, Ginette, I dance
In order not to betray myself
But in my mind I shout your name from the rooftops

I dance not to betray myself
But in my mind I shout your name from the rooftops <|endoftext|> 
Ons are well-groomed travelers
Door drink and song, door sound and verse
Ours is exile from paradise
Ooral known but nowhere at home
Agter every border a foreign language
And every city sy cathedral
But wherever you sing or go
Your future in Africa

I am detached and stateless
Stranded at the Cape of Good Hope
Lost the north, tired of the west
So I went south
Here my voice speaks a foreign language
This is where I come home when I get lost
And even though I live on the blouberg beach
My heart is in the West

How long do you have to hang on?
Door card or Bible guide or book
By watter shelter that wind
Find your savior in watter stable
Under watter star or noorderlug
Bly our hobble blind and sonder sug
Slegs that suider cross wag lank already there
Our future in Africa



In the running water of the Rhine
I see the centuries that have passed
The continent of vanity
Where every road to Rome leads
I passed the Swartberg Pass
Hell was more beautiful than I thought
Now I'm on the other side
But my heart is in the West

Ash that would finally throw sy mantle
Ash die son from white to red
When that city is quiet people get scared
There was nothing more to do in that area
Sal us know what turn our feet
Back to that dark continent
That last spring will soon follow
Wag our future in Africa

If I ever leave everything behind
My language, my city, my house, my hearth
Then there is still a part of me
Which remains in the north
Even though I love life here
Though my old world is sick
Self-righteous and arrogant
Yet my heart lies in the West

Although I know the fire is burning here
My heart is in the West <|endoftext|> 
You ask what I feel
I say what I think
That's how I avoid war
Because I am running away
Before the fight

It's not a question
Good or evil
And it is not an issue
Whose is right
Maybe it was different
Or better gone
At another place
In a different time



The last word
The last dance
The last light
Then night falls
Lately
I thought
It is no more
Like it was

I'm not defending myself
What if I live
I will not understand
What moves me
I don't believe in goodbyes
Because as long as I exist
I know you too
Watch the sun rise

The last word
The last dance
The last light
Then night falls
Lately
I thought
It is no more
Like it was <|endoftext|> 
Let it go
It's been so long
Make a new beginning
Like a cool wind through your heart

Let it go
You are already tired
Take a rest
And look ahead

You have so much to give
And so much to live for
When you break free from loneliness
Don't get mad at the past
But be grateful for the present
Put your tears and worries aside
And you set yourself free
Alone or with me
Oh, set yourself free



Let it go
It pulls you down
do not look back
But follow the sun

Let yourself go
And let your heart speak again
Who determines the way
Oh, and make it to the finish line
Is free
Is free

You have so much to give
And so much to live for
When you break free from loneliness
Don't get mad at the past
But be grateful for the present
Put your tears and worries aside
And you set yourself free
Alone or with me
And you set yourself free
Alone or with me
Oh, set yourself free <|endoftext|> 
I don't know how or what happened to you
You no longer belong to me
Every day you start again with that nagging
You much rather be free
You have said it enough times
The door is open, you can leave

So let go
Go fly while you can
Live your own life
And enjoy it
Just let go
You are still planning far too much
And I'm not flying with you
So let go

I cannot understand that I have not seen it
That you are so different
It could be that I didn't want to, maybe
But I never recognized it
I will not get in your way
The door is open, you can go

Just let go
Go fly while you can
Live your own life
And enjoy it
Just let go
You are still planning far too much
and I'm not flying with you

So free your heart again
But don't regret it
Because once away from me
Is forever



So let go
Go fly while you can
Live your own life
And enjoy it
Just let go
You are still planning far too much
And I'm not flying with you

So let go

Just let go

So let go
Go fly while you can
But I'm not flying with you
So let go <|endoftext|> 
Every time you leave me
you say now it's over for good.
But when things get a little better
Then you claim that heart of mine again.
Go crazy with that insecurity
I'm letting go, yes I'm freeing myself now.

Every time you move on
you expect me to stand still.
Because you know you sooner or later
feel the urge to go back again.
I gave you back all your wings
I'm fed up, I want mine now too.

Let me go, let me go!
Give me room to live
I've already given away so much!
So let me go, let me go!

I have thought for far too long
It was you, destined for me.
And against your better judgment,
I kept putting myself aside.
Before it's really too late
I choose for myself!
Oooh!



Let me go, let me go!
Give me room to live
I've already given away so much!
So let me go, let me go!

Follow my heart with my eyes closed.
Away from the dark,
looking for the light.
Follow my heart with my eyes closed.

Oooh yeah!

Let me go, let me go!
Give me room to live
I've already given away so much!
So let me go, let me go!

Far too long I've stood still
but now it's over for good! <|endoftext|> 
Put an apple on my head
And throw the first stone at me
Hang yourself from the highest tree
My song will ring out forever

Make your mark on my chest
Pitch and feathers on my body
Put that sword on my throat
You won't tear my soul with it

I have love in my heart
I feel the power of life flowing through me here
My eyes open
And my arms wide
The fear and the doubt I put them aside
And whatever the morning may bring me
Will embrace it like the light of every day
And those few tears
I cry with laughter

Do whatever you want with me
I am free forever

Place your walls around me
Make me a martyr
Tie my hands, shut my mouth
My words are free forever

Burn your brand in my arm
Make me feel all your pain
Smash that whip on my back
You never break my dignity anyway

I have love in my heart
I feel the power of life flowing through me here
My eyes open
And my arms wide
The fear and the doubt I put them aside
And whatever the morning may bring me
Will embrace it like the light of every day




And those few tears
I cry with laughter

Do whatever you want with me
I am free forever

[Lange Frans]
Drag me through hell and back
My love will find its way back
Like a boomerang or a bungee cord
All I have is my balls and my word
Step onto the Guillotine with a smile
If that's what we deserve
Do you play God I think it's fine
I know who I am and I know my friends
But down the line is not on the ball
Steering is not done from shore
For those who eat when I fall
I die until my love will
Overcome I believe in things
My hope is never duped now
I can't lose at all
I have the love of my kids and a super woman!

[Marco]
I have love in my heart
I feel the power of life flowing through me here
My eyes open
And my arms wide
The fear and the doubt I put them aside
And whatever the morning may bring me
Will embrace it like the light of every day
And those few tears
I cry with laughter

Do whatever you want with me
I am free forever

Come on, come on <|endoftext|> 
I am sometimes too blind
to see what I have
Still get lost sometimes
even though I know the way

And I am free as a bird
who survived the storm
With the wind at your back
and I still complain sometimes

But I am happy
even though I don't see it
Too much dissatisfied with everything
too little satisfied with nothing

I feel lighter and lighter
because I can dance with sorrow
And I know 6 chords
but I usually only use three mmmh
Because I am happy
even though I don't see it
Too much dissatisfied with everything
too little satisfied with nothing

And I slowly become invisible
I disappear into the fog
I switch earlier
with what is now
That's how I get lost
Luckily I got lost
And I always get somewhere
welcomed with love

So I am happy
Even though I don't see it
Too much dissatisfied with everything
too little satisfied with nothing



I'm happy
happy happy
even though I don't see it


Too much dissatisfied with everything
Too little satisfied with nothing
Too much dissatisfied with everything
Not satisfied with anything

Not satisfied with anything .. <|endoftext|> 
He's walking down the street
Straight to the point
He sees a woman
He kisses her on the mouth
She is startled, she says
'You must be crazy'
He says 'being crazy is healthy'

She wants to hit him
but he can just bend over
She misses
She thunders to the ground
She says 'Hey, you must be crazy'
He smiles
And dances around, he says

Being crazy is healthy
Being crazy is healthy
Tomorrow I am God
Today I am Napoleon
Being crazy is healthy

He looks her deeply
Deep in the eyes
He says 'You must be true love'
She says 'You are crazy'
He says 'You are blonde'
And by the way, being crazy is healthy



She is slow
Overcome slowly
She suddenly speaks a different language
She says I want to start over today
I've been normal all my life

Being crazy is healthy
Being crazy is healthy
Tomorrow I am God
Today I am Napoleon
Being crazy is healthy

Oui, you zui, Napoleon. Mais je ne parle pas franí§ais. C'est une situation
Miserable ! Et your brush, ... your brush donc je suis et je suis fous, mais ...

Being crazy is healthy
Being crazy is healthy
Tomorrow I am God
Today I am Napoleon
Being crazy is healthy <|endoftext|> 
I press you close
my cheek and my hands on your face
I see you right here in front of me
even though it may be with my eyes closed
I still feel you around me every day
although I know it is not
so great the feeling
so great the loss

Your memory travels through time
because of the countless numbers between 0 and 1
like a small infinity
that I wear like a cloak
of you around me
because although the days often feel empty without you
the nights are much colder alone
The picture of you next to me
keeps dragging me through it

so i keep you trapped in oceans of time
where seconds last a lifetime
where everything arises and where nothing ever disappears
in my heart, in my love for you
where the clock strikes once every eternity
and direct the direction of immeasurability
my love turns the dream into reality
because I still love you so much
and although I sometimes lose you for a while
then I will find you in such a small infinity



Just a pinprick
you and me had
but that makes no difference
time is relative, aren't you my love
love doesn't count how long or how often
but how much

In memory you are with me forever

ooooooh oohhhhh

I keep you trapped in oceans of time
where seconds last a lifetime
where everything arises and where nothing ever disappears
in my heart, in my love for you
where the clock strikes 1 time every eternity
and direct the direction of immeasurability
my love turns the dream into reality
because I love you so much
and although I sometimes lose you for a while
then I will find you in such a small infinity <|endoftext|> 
You get out of bed and you walk carefully with your eyes closed.
It is dark in the house and you are looking for the button of light.
Half asleep, you hit your head and feel free to walk to the closet.

You pull a sweater off the pile and put it on the wrong way.
You take a sprint down the stairs but you don't see your shoes.
You're scrambling up and lucky enough to be just in time for a quick breakfast.

And yet you don't moan because
You're on roses
Although sometimes something trivial goes wrong
Intermittently
you can see how beautiful life is



You have a receipt if you are just late at your car
and for the umpteenth time you are in a clamp with your wheel.
Like a spear to the desk and back to your boss in no time.

And yet you don't moan because
You're on roses
Although sometimes something trivial goes wrong
Intermittently
you can see how beautiful life is

You shrug your shoulders, you keep whistling
and you fight every setback with a smile
You look at yourself and think: I love life
It's all just relative

You're on roses
Just because you were born here
You're on roses
Although sometimes something trivial goes wrong
Intermittently
You see how beautiful life is
You're on roses
Even if it goes horribly wrong now and then
At intervals you see how beautiful life is <|endoftext|> 
Burning with desire
the voice of my heart
I lost them for a while
night had fallen
the love around me
it seemed a thing of the past

But then you walked
into my life
right through everything,
I could not believe it
you gave yourself to me

Now you are with me every night
are you with me tonight
my life seems to make sense
as soon as you smile at me

I see the sun shining again
I feel your warmth around me
you make all the cold disappear
and all that
you do alone

it is difficult to put into words
what I feel with you so close to me
the ground beneath my feet
I really can't reach it



but that you're with me tonight
that stays with me tonight
I feel like coming home
now that you're there waiting for me

I see the sun shine again
I feel your warmth around me
you make all the cold disappear
and all that
you do alone
(only you)
you do alone
only you

It's hard to comprehend
how it goes in love
how all hope disappears
until it's in front of you
everyone knows where to find it
sooner or later
ohh i feel you

I see the sun shining again
I feel your warmth around me
you make all the cold disappear
and all that

I see the sun shining again
I feel your warmth around me
you make all the cold disappear
and all that
you do alone
only you
you do alone
only you <|endoftext|> 
Hoeehuuuuhh
It's Christmas
Hoeehuuuuhh
It's Christmas
Hoeehuuuuhh
It's Christmas

Come in
It's been a while since I saw you
But here you are
Fortunately, there is always this day
It's Christmas
Everyone together again
The most beautiful day of the whole year

Hey hey
Hoeehuuuuhh
Hoeehuuuuhh
It's Christmas
Hoeehuuuuhh
It's Christmas

Come in
It is hot here
And it's cold outside
Give me your jacket
We've got something you love
Have a seat
Eat and celebrate with us
There is enough for everyone

Heeeeeh heeeej
Hoeehuuuuhh
It's Christmas
Hoeehuuuuhh
It's Christmas
Hoeehuuuuhh
It's Christmas

Even at Christmas everything feels equally free
When love reigns and fear disappears
We open our hearts to you
The problems are small
Every day
Let Christmas be



3x It's Christmas
oeeeeehoeeeh
5 x It's Christmas <|endoftext|> 
I'm still in the room
it is already a quarter to two
I am waiting for you
and feel the cold
it even snows on TV
I try to read me warmly
but that makes no sense either
because every time
then I'll come again
back at the beginning

you don't need me
everyone sees that
I am redundant
you can manage alone
because if you miss me
then you would come here



we agreed
to see each other a little more
but the moon disappears
and the sun appears
you're still not here

you don't need me
everyone sees that
I am redundant
you can manage alone
because if you miss me
then you would come here

because if you missed me
then I was not alone now <|endoftext|> 
I put on a mask
and when friends ask for it
I say it's delicious
only
the photos are already off the wall
as if I can forget
that I miss you how cold it is
how empty without you around me

I can not let you go
though I say it's better
alone and without you
I just can't handle it
I miss your arms around me
no i don't live in a world without you

i have tried almost everything
everything to forget you
I lie when they ask me how I'm doing
i read some books watch tv
but nothing changes with that either
I still feel
still longing
I still and still only think about you



I can not let you go
though I say it's better
alone and without you
I just can't handle it
I miss your arms around me
no i don't live in a world without you

time stands still
the time that heals all wounds
does not pass without you

I can not let you go
even though I scream it's better
alone and without you
I just can't handle it
I miss your arms around me
and everything about you that I love so much
which I love so much

no i don't live in a world
without you <|endoftext|> 
(Verse)
Lately when you touch me I feel something I don't trust.
Every time you look at me I think this look doesn't belong to you.
You're cheating on me ...
ooh..I feel like I'm losing you, tell me if I have to let you go.
Whenever I touch you, ooh I'm startled when I'm next to you.
You're cheating on me ...
I can see it in your eyes.

(Chorus)
Do you not want me around you, would you rather be alone or are you suddenly looking for the heart of a lover.
Love is over, don't you care about me anymore?
Can you find everything you are looking for with that other lover?

(Verse)
Last time you kissed me it looked like it was someone else.
I cannot rest no
ooh because I know.
Because you're cheating on me, I can see it in your eyes



(Chorus)

(Verse)
aIf you have the guts say it to my face and look at me.
When you tell me it's over I'll let you go.
You're cheating on me..oooooooh

(Chorus) 2x

Because you are cheating on me!
I can see it in your eyes .... <|endoftext|> 
You let in my world.
It had never been more beautiful.
An endless beginning.
That you normally only read books.
And although deep down I knew.
That this wouldn't be forever.
I would do it again.

With heaven as the goal.
I shot the stars and the moon past.
Therefore follow my feeling
But the gates remained closed for me.
And I knew I was going to fall.
Because as high as I had flown.
I would do it again.

You're gone and my heart is mine again.
But it misses you, yes it misses you.
The silence here is deafening all around me.
But take me back to then.
I would do it again.

Suddenly it is over.
The memory numbed me.
It was the best time for me.
It shouldn't have been.
I really didn't want to miss it.
Although the price I pay is now heavy.
I would do it again.

You're gone and my heart is mine again.
But it misses you, yes it misses you.
The silence here is deafening all around me.
But take me back to then.
I would do it again.



I wouldn't want to know anything again.
Not sleeping, not eating.
No, rather the pain than the love with you.
(Forget all those moments)

I do not want to know.

You let in my world.
It had never been more beautiful.

You're gone and my heart is mine again.
But it misses you, yes it misses you.
The silence here is deafening all around me.
But take me back to then.

I'd lose again in that very first kiss
Yes, I would do it again in a minute. <|endoftext|> 
You just stand there staring
Rained out in the dark
You rub the wet hair
Tired from your face
You keep waiting restless
Until I take the first step
You know how cold the night is
How chilly the twilight
You lure me with your lips
Seduce me with your eyes
I crave your hands
Your arms around me
But it is a deep pitfall
I don't want to fall into
Because as soon as the sun starts to shine
You leave me alone again

And I know you are going
When the morning comes
And I do not want that
If you fall into my arms now
Then I want you to stay

In both your eyes
Can be read loneliness
Silence has proven
To be merciless
I find it just as difficult with
As if to live without you
Between hate and love
Is a very thin line



And I know you are going
When the morning comes
And I do not want that
If you fall into my arms now
Then I want you to stay

I want to believe you
But I just know
That you leave me again
Yes I know you are going
When the morning comes
And I do not want that
If you fall into my arms now
Then I want you to stay

I rub the wet hair
Tired from your face <|endoftext|> 
I love you
For now and forever
My heart and soul
Never want to lose you

I love you
My whole life long
I knew immediately when I saw you standing there
That this would never go away

Because I belong with you
With everything I am, I choose you today
Right through the sea of ​​time
I'll bring you eternity
I belong with you



Even if the waves are so high
Love takes us through it
I have never felt it more strongly than now

I belong with you
Even if my heart ever stops
Does it belong to you
To you and to you alone
I don't want to go anywhere else
I belong with you

I love you <|endoftext|> 
I do not live for you anymore
Gone are all the years
What I believed in
That we were happy
And now that life is mine again
My heart has been free for a long time
Am I so glad it's over oh oh

I do not live for you anymore
You don't have to try
To stand here
And dominate me
I've had to endure too much
I've had enough of all your cures
So it's time to send your way
oh oh oh oh oh

I do not live for you anymore
I do not live for you anymore
Gone are all nights
That I am very alone here
Been waiting for you
You lied to me very hard
Messed up and cheated
So dry the tears in your eyes
I do not live for you anymore



You lied to me very hard
Messed up and cheated
So dry the tears in your eyes
I do not live for you anymore

So just get out of here
I can't take it anymore
And if you want to leave
Is that just a blessing
Too many times you have let me down
I've had enough of all your troubles
You just have to pack your things
ah ah ah
NO!
I do not live for you anymore

It's over
Yes over
For you
For me
It's over <|endoftext|> 
Everyone walks around me with an arc
Afraid to hurt his soul
Afraid of the anger
Marked on my face
With words like weapons
As sharp as my tongue
I knock the luck out of my hands
Alone in the dark
The doors and windows are closed

Cold is my world
It's snowing in my heart
There is ice on the whites of my eyes
The water is gone
The love that flowed through me
The stones are strong and the wall is high
Seal the doors and windows
I want to break through them but I cannot reach them inside

I can not do it alone,
No
I can not do it alone
I have the hand of the night on my throat
The loneliness is too much for me
I can not do it alone
Alone alone



Oh I cry for your love
But be as silent as the grave
I crave you
Still, I reject you
My "leave me alone" is a "don't leave me alone"

Don't mind my words
Don't hear what I'm saying
And keep trying
Even if I send you away
Don't see my mask
But please look through me

I can't do it alone, no
I can not do it alone
I have the hand on my throat the night
The loneliness is getting too much for me
I can not do it alone
Only <|endoftext|> 
(Willy and Willeke Alberti)

Recently, we took out a nice prize from the lottery
I said to my friends take a nice trip with me
He wanted to go to Brussels or Paris, who wanted to go to London again
"Come on" I cried, "we are taking a nice trip along the Rhine"
In a jiffy, damn ditch, the club was on the boat

refr .:
    Yes such a trip along the Rhine, Rhine, Rhine
    In the evening in the moonlight, shine, shine
    With a nice pot of beer, beer, beer
    On the pan, pan, pan, on the river, four, four
    Such a trip with a newfangled barge, barge, barge
    All in the cabin, juit, juit
    It's so elegant, it's so fine, fine, fine
    Such a trip along the Rhine

That is how we arrived first, with beautiful weather, at Cologne
My aunt waltzed across the deck like a young foal
Suddenly she took a harmonica and started pulling it
And immediately crooked Teun sang "Deutschland, wass bist du schoen"
Cousin Saar, what danger, shouted out loud "I am so bad"



refr.

Lightning came at Mannheim, the wind started to blow
My aunt yelled "the ship is wrecking, we're for the sharks"
She flew to the command bridge and shouted "Kap'teintje,
Downstairs in the first class, there is still my underguard bag
Oh captain, don't be kidding, give me a sip of brandy soon "

Yeah

refr. <|endoftext|> 
I grab some coffee and the morning paper
I walk up the stairs with your cup in my hand
I think about the past and I feel the pain
Where would you be now?
And I think about the moments
I've had with you
To the life we ​​shared
When you were still close to me

And I wonder: Is there someone else like you?
Who gives me love
What a person lives for
Just like someone like you
Someone perfect for me
Someone just like you

Between papers next to the wastebasket
I have a picture of us together on the beach
I can feel the sea gently past my feet
It's like we're standing there again

And even if it has been a long time
That you were still here next to me
I relive all those moments
About 1000 times a day



And I wonder: Will I ever find someone like you?
Who gives me love
What a person lives for
Someone like you?
Someone perfect for me
someone like You

I see you every day
What I do, you are there
And I just can't go on
Because you are still alive
You still live in me

(Somebody like you
Who gives me love
What a man lives for)

Just like someone like you
Someone perfect for me
Someone like You <|endoftext|> 
Everything that was of value to me
is made worthless
Bring my clothes and my furniture
and kick me out of my house
steal my video and my tv
get my money out of the safe
roll my pockets, tow my car
I'll go by bike
They can take whatever they can
No it really doesn't bother me
Because you are enough for me
I have enough of you

Take my keys and my giro card
and I still feel rich
My computer and my briefcase
and preferably at the same time
I've had way too much of everything
and was always under pressure
so if they steal all my expensive stuff
I keep dancing with happiness
Because you are enough for me
Enough for you

I give my things to charity
they get everything at once
when I feel your arms around my waist
then I feel rich
Because you are enough for me



Bring my clothes and my furniture
and kick me out of my house
steal my video and my tv
get my money out of the safe
I have enough of you
I have enough of you

Roll my pockets, tow my car
I'll go on the bike
They can take whatever they can
No, it really doesn't affect me
because I have enough of you <|endoftext|> 
refr .:
    Life is a carousel
    Anyone who does not know that will still notice
    Because, whoever is in it will not soon be out
    There we just sit together
    And turn, turn, turn
    Until we close our eyes in the end



Just like at the fair, life goes on
All people revolve around each other
Looking for happiness, even if it takes a while
Then let the wheel of fortune turn

I can stare for hours
On the old Willemsbrug
Think about my old neighbors
Back to everything
Where I often played as a child
And shared joys and sorrows
Neighborhood I never want to miss
And which I will never forget

refr .:
    I love you beautiful Amsterdam
    Where I was born as a child
    City with your beautiful canals
    You are always on my mind
    And when I think of the Jordan
    I see the old Wester standing
    Then I never ever repent
    That I love Mokum



I often walk down the street
And then I stop for a moment
Where my mother lived
In the middle of the Jordaan
I see the old pot house again
Where I spent many years
It's like time goes back
Then I get it

Nobody knows why
the day turns to night again
Nobody knows why
the sun is still shining
Nobody knows why
the chilly wind would still blow,
but i know i love you

Nobody knows why
the stars are falling
Nobody knows why
death follows us
Nobody knows why
there are people sleeping in the cold,
but i know i love you

refr:
Hold me
put my head on your shoulder sweetly
hold me
caress me gently through my hair
hold me
sometimes it all just becomes too much
and being with you is all I want.



Nobody knows why
happiness sometimes blows away
Nobody knows why
a flower withers
Nobody knows why
you're the only one i trust
but i know i love you

Hold me
put my head nicely on your shoulder
Hold me

Don't ask me, don't tell me
put your arms around me
don't talk to me
hold me tight
words fall short
when I pour my heart out to you
don't talk to me
hold me tight

When the evening has come
And we sit together like this
Can I sometimes sit and dream
How we came to each other
Then I will philosophize
And then I sometimes think
When love dwells in both hearts
Ah how beautiful life is then

It can be paradise
Even when we are old and gray
If we always go through life together
Because nothing can ever hurt us
As long as we always try
When worries arise, always stand side by side
What will ever happen
You are most important to me
Because you leave me alone
My happiness goes with you
It can be paradise
Happiness will be our prize
If we always go through life together
No, nothing can ever hurt us
If you always will try
To always be by my side with all your love <|endoftext|> 
The neighborhood where I played as a boy
Where I fought in the narrow streets
Where I shared joys and sorrows in poverty
And bought a thumb drop for a penny
Sunday school was for Sunday
And on Mondays warmed-up clique
A district that was in the heart of the city
Just behind a vinegar factory

refr .:
    I started looking for that neighborhood
    That neighborhood no longer exists
    Only in books
    And photos from yesteryear
    That neighborhood has disappeared
    That neighborhood is finished
    The neighborhood where my parental home used to be
    It's no longer my neighborhood
    It is over
    Just a piece of sentiment
    Is that neighborhood for me

I can call it my neighborhood
With aunties galore
I can boast of it
That I still know all the names
Where have those people gone?
They couldn't separate
That neighborhood was a lifetime
Sometimes you just want to forget it



refr.

Convicted without a chance of pardon
Not suitable for society
What does the new generation know
About this neighborhood of mine
I can talk about it for days
It will be an endless story
We will leave it at that
Because who still understands our language

I started looking for that neighborhood
That neighborhood no longer exists
Only in books
And photos from yesteryear
That neighborhood has disappeared
That neighborhood is finished
The neighborhood where my parental home used to be
It's no longer my neighborhood
It is over
Just a piece of sentiment
A dream is that neighborhood of mine <|endoftext|> 
(Willy & Willeke Alberti)

I am looking for beautiful phrases about love and love
When I think of you
I dream of blue seas, of the most beautiful orchids
And of eternal fidelity
I make poems for you that you will surely give in to
If I told them
But then I hide everything with that hackneyed sentence
"I love you"

At the same time, I immediately understand in shock
I interrupted your dream
At the most exciting moment, when you are very close to me
I don't give a single word



I would like to say a lot to explain clearly to you
How much I dream about you
But all the beautiful words that you have heard a thousand times
Sound way too bland
Although I try again and again, forget every time
What I wanted to tell you
And then I spoil everything with that hackneyed sentence
"I love you"

Lalala

Although I try again and again, forget every time
What I wanted to tell you
And then I spoil everything with that hackneyed sentence
"I love you"

I love you
I love you <|endoftext|>

In Spain I found a song
I heard it along the beach
It was or this melody
Was sunbathing in the sand

It tickled your legs
It was somewhere on your back
It crept past your bare toes
Along your hand and then back again

Somewhere in the surf a gentleman was singing
Lalalalalala lalalala
And on a terrace, that sounded again
Lalalalalala lalalala



refr.

I was on the Costa Brava
I ate well in Madrid
The cook said "For the paella."
Do you know this, this will be a hit "

This song is very special
This song that makes you happy
Now you can hear it in the poleder
In the city and along the meadow

If you don't believe it, just sing it
Lalalalalala lalalala
Even a pessimist still laughingly says "yes"
Lalalalalala lalalala

refr. (3x) <|endoftext|> 
Boys come and have a look, the car is in front
The thieves are being driven away
Then you see the bastards, their hands handcuffed
Who sometimes didn't do the worst
Sometimes it is a boy, unemployed for a long time
Who did it because he couldn't earn anything
You often see the mothers at the station
Who stand quietly in a corner whining

refr .:
    Never laugh when you see that car
    You can certainly regret them
    Just think: what he did
    Can happen to me tomorrow too

How cruel it is when you walk along the street
And you see that opulence everywhere
Then you start thinking - how beautiful to be rich
How poor we are, poor people
And if sometimes your children ask for bread
You can't even give them that
Then you steal - because it's for your child
That has the right to live



refr.

It is always not a thief who enters the car
And that is of course the beauty
Sometimes it is those guys who don't want to serve
And they throw them in jail
But he who kills - and has money, such a scoundrel
He is always avoided that shame
However, he is not transported with that car
But drove his own car

Once a boy went through the streets of Milano
Who had sung beautiful songs so many times
That was his job, he always sang in sun and rain
Never grieved, sang his song happily, he was pleased

Like a real troubadour
He played his guitar
Sang a song by l'amour
He met her in the street
Then he waited impatiently
Whether she might come back again
The prettiest girl in town
That he so worshiped in silence
And if the people stopped
Listening to his songs
He looked longing for her
In his dreams saw her as his bride
Like a real troubadour
He played his guitar
Sang a song by l'amour
He met her in the street



One day he stood singing in front of her house again
And thought: even if I only get a smile for a reward
He waited a long time and had the wildest dreams
If only she would say yes, he would be his wife

Like a real troubadour
He played his guitar
Sang a song by l'amour
He met her in the street
Suddenly a radiance came to the house
bridal couple at home and he recognized
The prettiest girl in town
All his hopes had vanished
That he so worshiped in silence
His dream had come true, his happiness broke
All his hopes had vanished
And a tear ran down his cheeks
He went his way alone from now on
He played his guitar
Sang a song by l'amour
He met her in the street

Don't ask where is the troubadour, nobody knows where
He sang his songs for her for the last time <|endoftext|> 
Don't just dance with my arm around you anymore
I will dance with you tonight I will wait more than a year
At the party that starts now and suddenly you are there
Your cheek against my cheek, the night will last so long



Don't dance alone now, with my arm around you
What I'm telling you now so softly in your ear
You knew that for sure
Forget sorrow that disappeared I'll never leave you alone

Don't just dance with my arm around you anymore
What I'm telling you now so softly in your ear
You knew that for sure
Forget sorrow that disappeared I'll never leave you alone <|endoftext|> 
"you are so wise", says a child
"you are so gray", says a child
"you are married", says a child
"you are already old", says a child

then you think "yes, one more wrinkle"
you really become an old gentleman
but before you think "how should that be"
she takes your hand and smiles at you



a child's smile makes you realize you are alive
the smile of a child who still has a life ahead of him
that life is worth living
sometimes with a bit of sadness, but with love, happiness and joy ahead

the smile of a child playing with a train or doll
his smile makes you happy, no party can beat that
what does it matter that you get older, that doesn't matter anymore
because you feel happy even if you have no money

what does it matter that you are getting older, it does not matter anymore because you feel happy even if you have no money <|endoftext|> 
In a poor, simple cabin
Let me see one there
There is a feather bed
A girl of about ten years old

That's sweet Annie
Who had her eyes sad
And her pink, pink colors
Walked off her cheeks

One night she called Mother
Kiss me for the last time
Sit with me awhile
I will not be alive tomorrow



Give the doll to my sister
And the pigeons to Koos
When the darling said this
She closed her eyes forever

One, two, three, four days later
When she was in her box
She was taken to the silent graveyard
Brought to her grave

Ah how the poor mother cried
Oh how that poor woman cried
That she was her dear Annie
Never see if you would kiss again <|endoftext|> 
refr .:
    Brown eyes don't cry
    Tears speak of grief
    Those are clouds for the sun
    Girls should be happy
    Red eyes hurt so much
    Drops from a love spring
    Brown eyes don't cry
    Tears speak of grief
    Darling have mercy
    it may be my sentiment
    But I can't see tears
    You have to laugh at me

In love, a man cannot see tears
His sunny heart may then become too small
Everything he loves is spoiled by him
A man's heart then beats with temperament
So when a girl starts to cry
Does she have grief that spreads to me
Then I want to come and cry
When she comes to hide with me
Then we kiss the grief past

I give you everything
My soul, my bliss, my love and my loyalty
I pick the flowers covered by the dew
I do all of that for you

I cannot write poetry
But all my words together make up a song
I hope you understand the content of the text
And that you will understand everything

You are like a pearl in my hand
A lily on the waterfront
A fascinating painting



It sounds corny
I give you everything, everything you ask of me
I count the shells on the silver beach for you
Because love breaks with every mind

No one has ever figured this out
It is simply determined by fate
And that's why I thank God for it

I give you everything
My soul, my bliss, my love and my loyalty
I pick the flowers covered by the dew
I do all of that for you

It sounds corny

    You are like a wild orchid
    Who sees nothing but the sunny side
    You broke many hearts and mine too
    Your love and loyalty were soon over
    You are like a wild orchid
    Who lives only from admiration
    Yet the times will come when people will avoid you
    Then know that one more cares about you

Although I have also known so many girls
You rose to my head like wine
You haven't spoiled me with your love for long
Yet no other will ever be

(Willy Alberti & Johnny Jordaan)

I was born there as a child
I have romped and played there
I lost my heart there
I have communicated a lot of suffering

And where I come, on the earth
Although it is also far from here
Then I will always tell about you
Of that beautiful, that fine Jordaan

refr .:
    At the foot of that beautiful Wester
    I have often had in mind
    I've often been dreaming
    Of that beautiful, that fine Jordaan

I dream of bridges and canals
The geraniums noble in color
The porter in dark nights
The peeler has a great smell



I can still hear them screaming those boys
From mussels to pickle
The water dripping past my teeth
And my heart became full of fire

refr.

And there are also gray hairs
The wrinkles of worry, perhaps
Yet I remain as proud as a tiger
Still I want to see you one more time

And soon the bell of divorce will sound
Although I will soon have to go crippled too
To die where I was born
In your fine and proud Jordaan

Now it is late
And the night falls over the sea
And the waves
Be nothing more than a sound
Sails the ship
From my imagination
To search
To whom fights and survives
Now it is late
And the night falls
And the night falls over the sea

I'm looking for the drowning man
Which has been missing for years
Maybe somewhere
Floating on the last wreckage
Who never grabbed the lifebuoys
Because he knew
That he was not born
Before this time



I'm looking for the woman
Which against all currents
Seeks a new world
Where everything is dreamed
That one day
Finds paradise on earth
And then declared crazy
Nobody believes

Now it is late
And the night falls over the sea
And the waves are no more
Then a sound
The ship sails
From my imagination
To look for who fights
And survives <|endoftext|> 
I see faces on television
Every laugh, every feeling memorized
It has all been rehearsed
It's all fake
It's all fake

Beautiful girls give prizes
To the winner of a quiz
Who knew nothing at all
Look, he has a smile on his face
Because he thinks "It's all fake"
It's all fake

    It's all fake
    All fake

Yes, it is all fake
It's all fake

Paris at the end of the century
Le Chat Noir has already made its name
Boredom strolls down the street
And there is a lot of talking

About the last scandal of the day
About Dreyfus and the Law of a Jew
And Nietzsche is losing his mind in Turin
And the workers think about bread

The city is tired of peace
And means a war
A flight from boredom
Because innocence is cheating
But the trenches are waiting
With the fear in mind
And death dances with a mask
On a waltz
She is dancing on a waltz



Paris at the end of the century
The world spinning around
Like a blind man dancing on a waltz
On the brink of the abyss

Progress is a miracle of steel
Man made his monster
The century to come
Makes firewood from dreams
But the city of light slowly falls asleep

They are tired of peace
And means a war
A flight from boredom
From the parties and the balls
But the trenches are waiting
With the lonely nights
And death dances with a mask
On a waltz

The prophets no longer say what they see
Because the city has enough
On his mind
And nobody wants to listen because the future
Never has
Promised so much <|endoftext|> 
Deep in the south
People wake up
When the sun goes to sleep
In the great sea
There is singing
And the kids dance
And the course of things
Walks with them

And I'm in the rain
But I am not here
My head has let go of my heart
I'm in the rain and I was too tall
Too scared to stop



Deep in the south
Life seems simple
And the men sit at night
Around the square
You see them thinking
And you can hear them talk
About how the daylight
In the night disappears

Located deep in the south
Maybe my future
But I am so scared
That I will miss it
The far north
With its cold winters
The gray sky
Where the snow falls

But ... deep in the south
Life is slow
And the women sit in the evening
At their doorstep
You see them thinking
To a distant past
And they take peace
With what happened <|endoftext|> 
I see you standing there
At a lonely height
Like a star that went out
Continues to believe in himself
With a court around you
From puppets
They always agree with you
They want to keep what they have
They hang on your every word
They don't contradict you
Because you give them work
You feed them
You don't need anyone anymore
To believe in
Because you believe in yourself
At a lonely height



I see you standing there
At a lonely height
Like a star that fallen
Continues to believe in himself
The voices in your head
Silenced
Mirrors smashed
Blinded by the fight
Friends from the very beginning
The sworn comrades
You have forgotten them all
You betrayed them all
You didn't need anyone anymore
To believe in
Because you believe in yourself
At a lonely height

I see you standing there
At a lonely height
Far from the world
With your head in the clouds
You are above the tree line
In the eternal snow
Where the heart no longer melts
Where the child no longer plays
The attack from the past
Turned out just a flight
And now you cannot go any higher
And you can't go back
You have the ashes of friendship
Scattered over the sea
You have dreams of love
Thrown to the lions
You didn't need anyone anymore
To believe in
You believe in yourself
At a lonely height <|endoftext|> 
Along the canals, through the alleys
We run to the devil
Along God's ways
Because we follow blindly
For the danger, the wizard

The tower of the city is fading
It seems like the wind is carrying us
Higher, higher, higher
I see the laundry hanging out to dry
Though the wizard would be at the end
Being a Pied Piper
Then it is still worth it
Because he is a wizard



He can drop stars
He can make the days fly
He can deceive us all
We take it for granted
Verily, he is a wizard

With his words he builds a bridge
We are on the way
There is no way back
The miracle continues
As long as you don't explain anything
That's what the wizard says

And he walks on water
He freezes time
It never gets later
He has thousands of faces
And he speaks like a poet
And I'll let him
Because I don't believe what I see
I do follow, but I don't listen
I walk alone in this row
As long as I can be close to her
Because I'm only following for her
The Wizard <|endoftext|> 
Two little girls
Look at me
They speak a language
Which I cannot understand
I can see in their eyes
The sun set
I come home to a people
With a country without a name

They are at home everywhere
So always a stranger
And I know what it is
To live lost
Two little girls
Look at me
They sit there together
And I sing their name

And I cannot believe
How this people through the ages
Be disowned
And I think about the world
Where I was born
The sour faces
The calculated words

And I know tomorrow
Must travel further
But that I keep in mind
Will stay here
Because I think about the world
Where I was born
I look into their eyes
And I get lost

This life on the road
From east to west
From north to south
It shows me what I don't have
A bed
A harbor
And a house

This life on the road
This travel
Through time
This pretend something
Of all my words
Remains

This life on the road
It can be my heart
Smash to pieces
It can be love
So cool
There are already ships
Perish by



This life on the road
I drink it
I spit it out
In all words
I sing
In low light
And a lot of noise

I know the end
Of the day
I know the taste of saying goodbye
Before the love
Got ugly
I would have disappeared long and wide

This life on the road
It can be my heart
Smash to pieces
It can be love
So cool
There are already ships
Perish by

Through this life
On the way <|endoftext|>

You stood there and you got the flowers
You're close to the other side
The world almost at your feet
But spring has begun
And winter is over
And you dance
On thin ice

And I don't see a donquichotte

As a surrogate to God
And you twist yourself

Who shows the way
Who do you want to be
And where is the limit

Where does the journey go
Who pays the price
You dance on thin ice

Because they are waiting for you
You made your name
With what you used to be against
But the days are getting longer
Seasons pass

Where are you going
Who shows the way
Who do you want to be
And where is the limit

Where does the journey go
Who pays the price
You dance on thin ice

And I see you slowly disappear
In the distance in the fog
And I hope it is not true
And that I am mistaken
But I can no longer distinguish color
And slowly you turn gray
Because you dance ... dance ... dance ..
On thin ice

Mmmmm ... mmmmm ...
Where does the journey go
Who pays the price
You dance on thin ice
You dance on thin ice
You dance on thin ice
You dance on thin ... ice

Only your voice in the dark
I see everything you sing
Bright to me, without light

You are the voice of the times
And you heal my old wounds
You bring all the contradiction
Balanced in me

Until I fall asleep
Because I've lost a dream
Sing to me until I sleep
With unintelligibly beautiful words
Sing to me until I sleep
Because I've lost a dream

For you

When the turmoil of the storm wakes you up tonight
And you look out the window
And you see me standing on the moon
Tonight



Then I storm heaven
And if I lose
I lose for you
And for good reason

Maybe gravity is stronger
Maybe I was made to die
But if I fall
I fall like an angel
Who relies on good luck
Tomorrow I will conquer heaven for you

All gods are my allies
Even the devil is loyal to me
Tomorrow I will conquer heaven for you <|endoftext|>

She's not red, she's not blue
She remains true to her ideals



Yes, I am a member of a party
That party is good for me
That party has only one member
And that one member is me

When we meet it is short
Because there are never cutbacks
Only our hearts are poured out
That is the only commandment

Yes, I am a member of a party
And that match is good for me
When something is not as it should be
She adds actions to the word

One party, one member
And that's me
And that party
Darling, that's you
I am a member of a party
And that party is you
I am a member of a party
You are mine
You are my party <|endoftext|> 
Look at the sun in the sky
This is the end of the night
I was lost in the dark
I found my way back by touch
I used to be rich in words
I am still, I have changed
But my voice, my voice kept burning
This is the fire, you can warm yourself

Hear the language of my heart
Hear the language of my heart
Even though I sometimes sound broken
Broken and confused
It is the language of my heart

I've seen my reflection fall
I was in pieces on the floor
I got to know myself
Like a hero and like a dog
And there is not much left
Of all my tender violence
But now I also know my bad sides
And I am closer to myself



I sing the language of my heart
Hear the language of my heart
Even though I sometimes sound broken
Broken and confused
It is the language of my heart

I can take it or leave it
You may love me
You can hate me too
I am who I am
This is my world
This is my vote

Hear the language of my heart <|endoftext|> 
I don't need a house anymore
To make me feel at home
I don't need a drink anymore
To be myself
I only drink milk
As before
Because there is a woman
Who understands me

I don't need psychologists
To learn to live
I have a good mirror
Who knows me better
I don't need a guru
To be able to float
Because there is a woman
Who thinks of me



It's only tenderness that counts
Only the tenderness that counts
They can have everything from me
All my life all my money
It's only tenderness that counts

Somewhere deep within me
Lives a miracle
It's someone's voice
Which is no longer there
But I can hear him
In the dark
He told me
What I no longer knew

It's only tenderness that counts
Only the tenderness that counts
They can have everything from me
All my life all my money
It's only tenderness that counts <|endoftext|>

    Nothing is stronger
    Then the silence
    Nothing has so much power
    Like the silence of the night
    Nothing is stronger
    Then the silence
    Nothing is stronger than the word
    That no one hears

So much has been said today
So many people in the world
Have explained so much

Cancer on another
Because of those better knowers
But those better knowers should know better
And forget what they know because



refr.

Take an advance on death
Feel the silence around you
Who can tolerate silence
Never feels alone

Come here with me, hold me
And don't ask what I feel
Words say way too often
What I don't mean

In the sixties
I heard a voice
He didn't come from heaven
He didn't come from hell
So many beautiful words
And I didn't know who it was
That voice came from a box
On the cabinet

My mother said, "That's the radio"
I thought, "It's a miracle"
And I can live my whole life
Not without it anymore
That miracle

refr .:
    I like the radio
    I like the radio
    I like the radio
    Radio



I've never watched TV anymore
All those stupid games
What do you do with that
Just give me the illusion
From a woman I don't know
I hear her voice only for me
I think about the rest

refr.

In the morning I wake up with a voice that embraces me
And in the evening I go to sleep with a voice that warms me
I prefer to see the world with my eyes closed
And the ideal love is a love that is not obligatory

So, I like the radio
I like the radio
I like the radio
Radio <|endoftext|> 
I feel at home in all countries
I'm not standing still
I have a limitless feeling
I have found my own way
I carry the water to the sea
That is my goal
I was born a drifter
I'm only here for a while
I am a river

And

refr .:
    I flow through the ages
    Along castles
    I flow through the ages
    Along a city
    And in the end I lose myself in the sea
    I flow through the ages

I am a living legend
I've seen the plague come and go
I saw a love that continued to bloom
And I've seen ships wrecked
Where are the people along the shore
Why is no one taking their time anymore
I have time



Because

refr.

I
I am a river
I carry the wreckage
On my back
I
I am a river
And I always say goodbye
Because I will never come back

refr. <|endoftext|> 
I saw you go in the distance
You just looked up
With the devil on your heels
And with heaven in your head

I saw you go in the distance
I was transfixed
I saw you walking on water
To the setting sun

You went across the street
You went to no man's land
The ferryman has won your heart
And I, I have escaped the dance



I saw you go in the distance
You looked back at me one more time
As if you thought I would follow
As if you didn't understand why

I couldn't hear the voices
That you heard in your head
I saw you go in the distance
I saw you dance with death

You went across the street
You went to no man's land
The ferryman has won your heart
And I, I have escaped the dance <|endoftext|> 
I saw everyone start here
Which has now made its name
Saw all the singers and actors
With fear
Standing in the wings

I saw them go off before my eyes
Heard them scold when the room was not filled
And usually only the director got
And the public to blame

I saw the young guests
Who always played with their hearts
Most of them have been destroyed
Because of the frustrations and the hatred
From some old rat
Who never had their talent

refr .:
    I'll keep watch
    In this theater at night
    And sometimes I'm on stage
    There is only 1 role I play
    And that is this monologue
    I play it in front of an empty hall
    My life my story
    Not a dog that pays for it

I've seen an actress with talent
Wasted himself
Now she plays in such a shitty series
Every night on TV



I picture the star actor again
Who always asked
How I was doing
I just said "now you have to go"
I saw him play like a God
A man who never said what he thought
I seemed to see myself
I was crying like a child

I saw a singer sitting here
Very alone with a guitar
It wasn't bad but he still has
A long way to go

I've seen so many die here
I am no longer afraid of death
I've seen the lie here
Which at times may have seemed the truth
I've earned my botherham
If I have to go, I will keep up

I've worked here for so many years
And only now do I consider it
That if the last sleep takes me
No one ever in this room
From all the highly regarded public
Heard or saw me
I'm just saying it like it is
There won't be a dog that misses me

I'll keep watch
In this theater at night
And sometimes I'm on stage
There is only 1 role I play
And that is this monologue
I play it in front of an empty hall
My life my story
No dog ever pays for it <|endoftext|> 
I thought, but kept silent way too much
I've talked but rarely said anything
I fought, but often did not know what against
I know my limits but I have never pushed them

I was a smooth talker to the audience
I always found just the right word
But mostly that was mostly theater
And I said that what people prefer to hear



But to let my heart speak to you
To those I love so much
Unfortunately I had to really break my mouth open
'Cause I never just said "I love you"

I hope I made you feel anyway
That sometimes my gaze was enough for you
And that despite my simple flaws
You knew how much I love you
You have known, not forgotten, never forgotten
How much I love you <|endoftext|> 
How would it be
When you were in my arms again
How would it be
If I saw your beautiful eyes
How would it be
When I blindly
Find your lips again

How would it be
When time was turned back
And all the pain
Was blown over just like that
When my heart
Wouldn't be so tired anymore
And rest with you
How would it be
How would it be



Where would you be
Are you very far from here now?
Do you sometimes think about me too?
And how it had gone differently
Are you alone
Or is your heart inhabited again
And has the time
You now finally get rewarded
How would it be
How would it be
How would it be

How would it be
When I woke up
And you would be next to me
How would it be
How would it be
How would it be <|endoftext|> 
The low sky
Is gray and heavy
She stands alone
In all weathers
She sees the sea
And only wants to
Be again
Such as
A child

There was a prince
Looking for her
She saw him
Before bedtime
The castle in the air
The White Horse
He is
Perhaps
Strayed



She waited
She had patience
She only gives
Blame himself
She is always here
Stay
And never
Looking
Gone

The low sky
Is gray and heavy
She stands alone
In all weathers

She sees the sea
And only wants to
Be again
Such as
A child
Are ... like ... a child <|endoftext|> 
You look at me but you don't see me
When I buy the newspaper in the morning
You lie in front of me and you smile
And looks at me, but you don't see me
Because you're on the front
From some leaf

I see you but you don't see me
If you are in a panel again in the evening
The best are in the house
I see you go, but you don't notice
Because after five minutes
I'll turn you off with a button



What is known
It's not art
There are those with talent
Most do without it
You only see the circus
I see the lions' den
Now they still seem nice
But later
They get hungry

I hear your name
But I don't see you
But your star is rising in the statistics
So that's okay
I hear your name and I sing this song
And I hope you are happy
With what you do
Because

What is known
It's not art
There are those with talent
Most do without it
You only see the circus
I see the lions' den
Now they still seem nice
But later
They get hungry <|endoftext|> 
The sky is breaking
The rain is falling
The storm is dying
And we are still together
After a search through the valley

You stand in front of me
I am in front of you
Face to face and without words
We may have been for years
Married to each other

But I'd rather break
Then bend
For a world
Who wants to hear
That I love you
If I said yes
Is it without words
Without words and witnesses
In silence in nothingness
With the power of the music

Love flows
From high to low
Heaven and Hell
Could never exist
Without each other



And for life
I don't promise
Because there are no words
Big enough
For what you feel or see

And I'd rather break
Then bend
For a world
Who wants to hear
That I love you
If I said yes
Is it without words
Without words and witnesses
In silence in nothingness
With the power of the music

I am not a prince
This is not a dream
There are houses in the world
Where love has disappeared
Because I lived there

I release you
As long as you stay with me
But I don't sign for love
Because with the fear of losing
You always lose everything <|endoftext|> 
I have the keys, the doorknob in my hand
But I doubt whether I can still really go inside
Your every move seems away from me
I haven't seen your heart open for so long

Do you want to know how it dances without me?
Maybe you have more balance without me
If I have to, I will step aside
If it is better, if it is better

Does life have more shine without me?
Will love get another chance without me?
If that is really the case, then I will release you
If it is better, if it is better
Don't mean to say I don't miss you

The front door opens and I slam shut again
Even though what I want to say is on my face, oh
I can't talk to you so I keep quiet
But it feels like you don't want to fight for me

Do you want to know how it dances without me?
Maybe you have more balance without me
If I have to, I will step aside
If that's better, if that's better

Does life have more shine without me?
Will love get another chance without me?
If that is really the case, then I will release you
If it is better, if it is better
Don't mean to say I don't miss you



Go and see how it dances
Go and see how it dances
It's not that I don't want to
But I seem to have been forgotten all the way
Wouldn't know which direction
Which way still leads to you

I have the keys, the doorknob in my hand

I'll learn how to dance without you
Even though I miss the balance without you
Oh, I hope I can do it without you
If it is better, if it is better

Go see how it dances without me
Give love another chance without me
If I have to, I will step aside
If it's better, if it's better

Go and see how it dances
Go and see how it dances
Do you want to know how it dances without me?
Maybe you have more balance without me
If I have to, I will step aside
If it is better, if it is better

Don't mean to say I don't miss you <|endoftext|> 
She had fallen that day
Just when he saw it
He helped dry her tears
And fell in love with her smile

He had fallen for her
But since she got up
She seemed to have been forgotten
What he did for her

He didn't know how to behave
And he didn't want to ask her
Too afraid she wouldn't understand him
Because what should he say
If he had to explain that

And so he waited
But he is still waiting and still alone

He wanted to say it
How much he loves her
But for those heavy words
His heart was not built



And he doesn't dare to call her
To tell her everything
That he has had her number all this time
It's been way too long
She probably never thinks about the past

And so he waits again
And maybe he's alone forever

He wanted to say it
How much he loves her
But for those heavy words
Will it be later when it waits and so it will wait later ... it is way too old

She feeds her cat
And peers past the curtain
Then she suddenly thinks again
To that kid back then, to whether he would be alone too <|endoftext|> 
The moon is not lonely
He smiles and looks around
He doesn't think anything, he doesn't feel anything
So he doesn't feel alone either

The sun has no lover
She never heard of love
And yet she's on fire and on fire
And no one knows what for

The clouds that chase by
And go low over land
They have no purpose because
They got no understanding from God

Only the people who think
And that is why there is grief
But with the same thoughts
Make your heaven from nothing



You can pretend you are the moon
Far from here
With innumerable stars that always
Stand behind you

You can pretend to be the sun
That burns above us
Like dancing with the clouds
And looks at the sea and the land

There is always something behind it
Things as you see them
And if you look through that
Then you turn despair into music

The moon is not lonely
Countless stars that surround him
And you can see how he smiles
Because the moon never feels
Only <|endoftext|> 
Yes it is still there
The feeling very deep inside.
Oh what am I supposed to do without you

Yes it is still there
Two souls one thoughts
I will wait for you forever

Yes it is still there
Oh I can still feel it
Your hands soft as silk
Like you could seduce me with your smile

Oh I can still feel it



With my eyes closed
I know where to find you
I see your face

Oehoe oehoe oehoe (3x)

With my eyes closed
I know where to find you
I see your face
How you smile at me

With my eyes closed

Eagle owl eagle owl (4x) <|endoftext|> 
I stare over the water
That just like me
Was once on the move
Fathomlessly deep and menacing black
Just like what I read in your eyes
Dead blind, East Indian deaf
I want to be forever
Not to see or hear
All that is lost
I can't do without you
Eat, sleep, walk, dance, live

So I sit here now
And I will wait here now
Until the water ever starts moving again
And then I drift along
Up to the sea
Where you
Will wait for me

The sky is light
And endlessly
And so far above me
Untouchable and yet
So close
Just like you
It's written in the air
But it sticks to my lips
I can't do without you
Eat, sleep, walk, dance, live



And so I sit here now
And I will wait here now
Until the water ever starts moving again
And then I drift along
Up to the sea
Where you
Will wait for me

I stare over the water
That just like me
Was once on the move <|endoftext|> 
lately when you touch me
I feel something that I don't trust
every time you look at me
I think this look does not belong to you
you're cheating on me

oh i feel i'm losing you
tell me if I have to let you go
everytime I touch you
oh you scare me when i stand next to you
you're cheating on me
I can see it in your eyes

don't you want me around you
would you rather be alone
or are you suddenly looking for the heart of a lover.
love is over
you don't care about me anymore
you will find everything you are looking for in that other lover

A voice speaks in the distance
Which I recognize from our arguments
About minor misunderstandings
About big disillusions

And I hear the chilly sounds
From your restrained anger
But what can I do more than cry
If I couldn't suspect this

In a blur I hear you say
That you want to give up everything
That you take everything with you
What is dear to me in this life

And I listen to your words
Slowly get into the senses
That hit me like lightning
With destructive power

This chill drives me crazy
And this feeling is terrifying
But your words grind on
And my eyes look questioning



Why didn't you tell me before
That you were so alienated from me
WHY DO YOU TALK ABOUT LOVE
IF YOU NEVER LOVED ME

I lose it in despair
And I can feel my tears burning
And I would like nothing more
Then put my head back in your hands

But what until an hour ago
Still seemed so safe
Is a very big lie
And turned out to be a house of cards

It's like someone else
Has crawled into your body
And I didn't even notice
That it has crept in

To erase your love
And destroy my world
Nobody wants to tell me
That I have ... dreamed everything <|endoftext|> 
I am not superstitious
Horoscopes don't bother me
Life is an open question for me
On Friday the 13th
I get on my bike with a smile
And I can't look any further than today

But I can't reach this with my mind
This is proof from above

Because it cannot be a coincidence
That you lie next to me
With your arms around me
And close your eyes
It's going to be a coincidence
That you lie next to me
Although the chance of predestination is small
This is too good to be true



I don't do mascots
And I am not psychic
Although there is not much wrong with my eyes
No mortal predicts
Whether I'll see the morning light
So I hold on to that which is tangible

But I can't reach this with my mind
This is proof from above

Because it cannot be a coincidence
That you lie next to me
With your arms around me
And close your eyes
It cannot be a coincidence
That you lie next to me
Although the chance of predestination is small
This is too good to be true <|endoftext|> 
I looked where to look, turned the world upside down, was sure it didn't exist.
True love wasn't around for me, that's how I just decided the day you found me.
And I can still hear myself say it, don't take me too seriously, see what comes of it.
For which I had been well and truly pronounced, for a life of conclusions, a thousand shards lay on the ground

And I never want anything else.
I can't live a day without you.
I don't want anything to change.
You are what I love.
I give you all my heart, so don't leave me alone.
Life is so beautiful with you around me.
I never want anything else, you know, sweetheart.
You are the best I ever had.
You are the best I ever had.

No I never want anything else.
Ohohohohohoho.
I don't want anything to change.
Ohohohohohoho.
You are the best I ever had.

Love grabbed me by the hair, how had I ended up here again, it pulled me so deep into it.
And all the plans that I made just fell aside, and that was just the beginning.
Oh I think I know myself quite well.
But I do get thousands of mirrors, she keeps pulling me down.
Let them get up and run again, she's still two steps ahead, and yet I never want to get out.



No I never want anything else.
I can't live a day without you.
I don't want anything to change.
You are what I love.
I give you all my heart, so don't leave me alone.
Life is so beautiful with you around me.
I never want anything else, you know, sweetheart.
You are the best I ever had.
You are the best I ever had.

No I never want anything else.
Ohohohohohoho.
I don't want anything to change.
Ohohohohohoho.
You are the best I ever had.

And when we're old and gray later on on a park bench, I'll still look at you like that, my dear.
You are the best I ever had.
You are the best I ever had.

No I never want anything else.
Ohohohohohoho.
I don't want anything to change.
Ohohohohohoho.
You are the best I ever had.
You know my love
You are the best I ever had.
Ohohohohohoho.
You are the best I ever had.
You are the best I ever had. <|endoftext|> 
The dark puts the light on all my
fears and my questions
The dark

The dark makes me cry
heart break the silence
The dark
The dark extinguishes the lie, let the
speak truth louder
The dark
The truth that I am you at any time
so wrong every day

It hurts because I know how much you
sometimes needed me
and it hurts because I know that I am
just wasn't there for you back then
it hurts because I know that I am
have been the world to you
And it hurts because I know that I am
hurt you the most

The dark makes the distance between
us smaller again
The dark
the dark still does your image
keep appearing all of a sudden
The dark
I close my eyes and imagine
that you're still with me



It hurts because I never have you
seen for who you really were
Yeah, it hurts because when you left me here, that's when I felt it
It hurts because I know what I am
did myself with this
And it hurts because I know it
because of me that you have gone

I'm fine during the day
I ignore the past
but as soon as dusk falls
it keeps pulling me back
down

It hurts because I know it is now
someone else is next to you
And it hurts because I see he has the
brings smile back to your face
It hurts because I see you the
recognizes love in him now
And it hurts because it looks like you
forgot the time with me

The dark puts the light on all my
fears and my questions
The dark <|endoftext|> 
Wouldn't you like to be endlessly rich for a day
Awaken like a king and bathe in luxury
everything was gold you saw
For a day on the throne of a castle in the sky
But without your cloak
No one would see who you are anymore
An ordinary appearance that is fragile
is no longer recognized as king
Uninhibited and naked
A person comes into the world
And naked we leave here again
Because everything stays behind
Heal your property
Your hands are empty
at the end of the ride
Nobody is powerful
And everyone small
At the end of the line

Wouldn't you like to be more beautiful than beautiful?
if it were possible
succeeded in life
Famous and adored
As radiant and warm as the sun
Inept and naked
A person comes into the world
And naked we leave here again
Because
everything stays behind
Heal your property
Your hands are empty
At the end of the ride
Nobody is powerful
E everyone small
At the end of the line



everyone dances
Everyone laughs
Everybody knows
that the end awaits
any truth
is a lie
Because nobody in this paradise
Is ready at the end of the trip
Everything is left behind
Heal your property
Your hands are empty
At the end of the ride
Nobody is powerful
And everyone small
at the end of the line

At the end of... <|endoftext|> 
Oh I dream of it
For a lifetime
To prove my love to my love

To the top or through the valley
It does not matter
Where or you are
You don't recognize anyone around you



I am with you
Anytime
I am the angel of your heart

Oh you belong with me
And I with you

There is no one who can deny that now
In the light or through the night
It doesn't matter where or I am
I don't recognize anyone around me
You are always so close
You are the angel of my heart <|endoftext|> 
I sit alone, huddled
I am a shadow of the man I once was
my head is empty, my heart is broken
and my hands are still holding you.

and a day never passes
that I don't feel you anymore
or that I don't miss you anymore
and the bed is too cold for me
when it has not been slept by you.

this warm house is getting colder all the time
until time has erased your last traces

I scream your name and close my eyes
wait for an answer, even if it makes little sense
I keep believing that you hear my voice, even if it is against your better judgment.

and a day never passes
that I don't feel you anymore
and that I don't miss you anymore
and the bed is too cold for me
because it was not slept by you.



Our beautiful house is getting quieter and quieter
until you can't hear your voice anymore.

Oh my heart is shattered, my dream taken hostage, by loneliness
your voice is getting slower, your image is getting blurrier
oh I don't want to lose you yet!

and a day never passes
that I don't feel you anymore
and that I don't miss you anymore
and the bed is too cold for me
when it has not been slept by you.

This big house is getting emptier all the time
because everything is so meaningless without you.

so empty and meaningless <|endoftext|> 
Alone for a while
The silence around me for a moment
Just nothing at all
Get away from everyone
Just lost everything
Just one second without time
Just one count
Just one moment just for me

Don't worry
No interests
But for a short while
Just no tomorrow
No desire
Just take a break

Alone for a while
All alone



Alone for a while
I listen to the silence around me
Just nothing at all
A little far away from everyone
No weight for a while
No smile on my face for a while
Not a clown for a while
For a moment I close my eyes

Just for a moment
My thoughts
Completely free
Not having to do anything for a while
Do not expect anything
Just take a break

Alone for a while
All alone

Alone for a while <|endoftext|> 
It's not who you are
And what you do
You are important and you should know that

Because you are ready
For everyone
The quiet but also great power
Who never expected so much himself
That does not go unnoticed
You are the angel of our hearts

That's why I'm singing this
Especially for you
And anyone who can hear tonight
How you live
And what you give
And how you look at the world
what seems so obvious
That does not go unnoticed
You are the angel of our hearts.



Because you are ready
For everyone
The quiet but also great power
Who never expected so much herself
That does not go unnoticed
You are the angel of our hearts.

Just park
For the cafe
The remote control
That plays a role within
You see that car
He is one of them
Look at it shine
That's his certainty

Much to tell
Because he cannot listen
Always on the phone
And so that everyone sees it



What a figure
Hey! Nice guy
Just do it
Just be normal
Hey dude! be who you are
Just be yourself
If you remember it

Knows all guests
Don't ask how
Thinks he knows flawlessly
How to decorate
Full confidence
Not always wrong
Knows all women
But nobody knows who he is now, ha!
What a figure

Hey! nice guy
Just do it
Just be normal
Hey dude! Be who you are
Just be yourself
If you remember it
Hey dude na na na ... <|endoftext|> 
Wouldn't you like to be endlessly rich?
For one day
Awaken as a king and bathe in luxury
Everything you saw was gold
For a day on the throne of a castle in the sky

But without your cloak
No one would see who you are anymore
An ordinary appearance that is fragile
No longer recognized as a king
Uninhibited and naked
A person comes into the world
And naked we leave here again

Because everything stays behind
Heal your property
Your hands are empty
At the end of the ride
Nobody is powerful
And everyone small
At the end of the line

Wouldn't you like to be more beautiful than beautiful?
if it were possible
Successful in life
Famous and adored
As radiant and warm as the sun
Inept and naked
A person comes into the world
And naked we leave here again



Because
Everything is left behind
Heal your property
Your hands are empty

Just give me the last lap
I've seen it here
For today
I know everyone here
In this godforsaken pub
And I see in everyone
How I got stuck myself

Give me one last
Last round
I don't want to know tonight
Where I live
I'm only afraid of the dark
I'm afraid to go to sleep
I have been for years
The same dream



Hold me
Hold me
I don't want to go down just yet
Hold me
Hold me
And let me stand in your shadow

I have the keys
From my car
Thrown in the ditch
Not a dog waiting for me
Where do I have to go
I have no more money
Pay the very last round
And I'm dying
If you don't care about me <|endoftext|> 
I see the distance
In your eyes
You act like I don't exist
We have side by side
Fought
Now we face each other
And

It is too late
To determine
Who which mistakes
Has made
The judge has turned
Withdrawn
And this case
Declared barred



We each took a side
That is the price of the habit
The fall from self-evidence
You only see
What you want to see
If you look at me

It might be
The course of things
Because every fire
Will ever be put out
I feel how we do
Avoid each other
We are waiting for
The Kiss of Judas <|endoftext|> 
I'm the jester
At the court of the king
I'm on this stage
Outside of the law
I'm pretending
I am not afraid of anyone

But what I feel
Is not what I say
An opportunist, that's how I was born
I do what is asked of me
And between the lines of what I sing
I am the singer
Who sings to live
And they puke me sooner or later
I hide my dislike and hate

Yes I know the king
His lust and his life
I know his hunger for power
And I puke on his status
Because that's how he wants to hear it
I shit on his throne and he laughs

Because I am the court jester
Who can say anything
As long as just pleases the king
The troubadour who can sing anything
As long as I entertain people
And I am the whore
And you can look at me
Watch as long as you pay
I am the singer
Who sings to live
I am loved and hated
I am loved and hated

Because there in the wings are the other jesters
Ready to watch me fall in the gutter
A truth, a word can make my head roll
If the king doesn't smile, I'm dead



I have wanted to bow to nothing all my life
So I only bow to the public
And I know ministers can drink my blood
Because I sing what I see and I don't give credit

Because I am the court jester
Who can say anything
As long as just pleases the king
The troubadour who can sing anything
As long as I entertain people
I am the whore
You can look at me
Watch as long as you pay
I am the singer
As long as the world exists
As long as the world exists

And then one day I will break with everything
Then I seize power
Then I steal the crown
Then I scream now you are the jester
And I am the king
From now on you are dead, just plain

And then the curtain falls
And there will be no applause
The king is leaving
And slams the doors
But the other jesters, there in the wings
Ready as hyenas
To tear me apart

Because I am the court jester
Who can say anything
As long as just pleases the king
The troubadour who can sing anything
As long as I entertain people
I am the whore
You can look at me
Watch as long as you pay
I am the singer
Who sings to live
And they puke me sooner or later
I am the singer
Who sings to live
And they puke me sooner or later <|endoftext|> 
Every year is a movie
In which politicians act
In which statues with a smile
Demonstrate new weapons

Every year is a movie
It is made for the money
So you see little love
You just see a lot of violence

Every year is a movie
For the Hollywood archive
With a firework above
Baghdad, Sarajevo, Kigali



But who speaks of the extras
Ordinary people in all countries
People like you and me
Looking for happiness
People like you and me
On the run
The extras

The extras are made
For the big crowd scenes
You see them going in long lines
To flee or die

And they disappear in time
For an endless journey
None of them ever wanted a war
But they did pay the price

And at the end of the movie
You only see the big names
Those are the heroes of the year
That determine history <|endoftext|> 
You see her at a party
She has the highest word
She laughs and drinks too much
And she talks and talks on
She walks home alone
In the morning light
Through a silent city
And looks for a balance

She is an empty platform
She is the last train
She is the thinking
To what never will be
She is the trouble in the eyes
From someone who made it
Who is admired by lackeys and has lost himself

The loneliness
The loneliness
She is invisible to your eyes
She touches you from time to time
The loneliness



She is a beggar
Who asks for alms
She is the north wind that sweeps through the plain
She knows the dark side
Who gets the flowers
She knows the inside, she knows the vulnerability

She is the empty house
Where the wind blows through
She is the last man on the barricade
She is the slow time
Who does not heal wounds
She is the rich woman who drinks because she is bored

The loneliness ... the loneliness
She passes through the world invisibly
And she touches you from time to ... time
The loneliness <|endoftext|> 
When I was little, it was heaven
Somewhere up in the sky
And you could only get there
With a very last sigh
Everyone wore white sheets
And you walked golden streets
About squares with fountains
Full of red lemonade

And you flew through white clouds
And an angel held you
And you could walk on water
Because the water was made of glass
Everyone was happy there
Never go hungry again
No more pain
You only had misery here
Everything would be different there

But I don't remember
Where Heaven Is
I don't know where I'm going after this life
Then I saw heaven
With the eyes of a child
But that heaven has disappeared forever
Heaven has disappeared



I grew older and believed
In an an'dre fantasy
And I followed Zarathusta
With a kind of anarchy
Because I flew over the clouds
To a country far from here
But I didn't see golden gates
And I didn't see any fountains

And I don't remember
Where Heaven Is
I don't know where I'm going after this life
Sometimes I see the sky
In the eyes of a woman
But that usually only takes a moment

Heaven only lasts a moment <|endoftext|> 
The day will come
The hour will strike
That I see you
And will stand still
And leave everything
For what it is
It's written
Fate decides

The day will come
The hour will strike
My old world
Will perish
The wall will fall and
The boundary disappears
I will no more
Are the same

The day will come
The hour will strike
The rooster will crow
And I will betray myself
For you
For good
Forever
For as long as it continues to exist



The day will come
The hour will strike
The sun will never set again
The light will stay and the night will disappear
I will not be the same again

The day will come
The hour will strike
The rooster will crow
And I will betray myself

For you
For good
Forever
For as long as it continues to exist <|endoftext|> 
I've heard
That you are the stars of the sky
Have sung
Tonight
I've heard
That you the streets again
Made unsafe
In this city

I've heard
That you are the ghosts
In your head
Have overcome
And that you have peace
Found
With the war
In your heart

And I hope for you
That it always will be
And never again one day
Must bend
Until you burst



Because you have seen
You sang
Overcome and
Lost what you had
You went under
Because you no longer
Wanted to comply
To what happened to you
Was expected

I have so many
See them drown
Intoxicated
Of victory
I saw few
Like you
Those at the end of their tether
Start over

And I hope for you
That it always will be
And never again one day
Must bend
Until you burst <|endoftext|> 
I learned from Erich Kesner
That a word means so much
That you don't need many
To say what you feel

I learned from my grandfather
Which is now almost a hundred years old
That you only with your eyes
Can tell what you feel

refr .:
    And I like that simplicity
    I like that simplicity
    All that bloated language
    All those frills leave me cold
    I like that simplicity
    I like that simplicity
    I want a house, I want a love
    Which is built on rocks
    Because I like the simplicity



I learned from my father
To be fair
Even if that is a cliche
And even if it yields nothing

When I see you with that smile
With those stars in your eyes
God, you need so little
You are so beautiful standing there

I learned from my mother
That so many people live
That it is foolish to think
That the world revolves around me

He is a child like many children
He is neither more nor less
But when you talk, he hardly ever says anything back
He can disappear all day long
In a world full of secrets
He is restless and always on the run

He only lives in thoughts
And he seems to be waiting for something
But the train he is waiting for never passes
There are no drugs
That make the silence disappear
And there are still so many children like him

Break the silence
Break the silence
Break those walls around them
Word for word and
Brick by brick
Break the silence
Break the silence
Break those walls around them
Word by word
Brick by brick

If we follow them in their dreams
To discover where they live
Maybe then we'll find the way to their hearts



If we try to travel with us
And show them the way out
Maybe then they will find the words one day

Break the silence
Break the silence
Break those walls around them
Word for word and
Brick by brick
Break the silence
Break the silence
Break those walls around them
word for word and
brick by brick

They are at war with the world
They build walls around them
oooh But don't let go
Do not give up
Never leave them alone

Break the silence
Break the silence
Break those walls around them
Word for word and
Brick by brick

I am 1 more time
Walked past the house
Where you have lived
But isn't yet
Like it was
As if I dreamed everything

You know the Kreuzberg
From the Turks and the squatters
Not going back
Most are for the new rich
And the estate agents fled

Only the snow
Lies just like then
On the roofs of the houses
It can be cold
In Berlin

I have learned to travel alone



Bertolt Bercht
And Che Guevara
On the walls
In your room
Its as good as that
Forget
Because the wall has disappeared

Communism is broken
The ideals
Have been betrayed
And God is homeless
Because every church
Grown here
To a theater

Only the snow
Lies just like then
On the roofs of the houses
It can be cold
In Berlin
I have learned to travel alone

I travel around the world
I still have so much
To describe
Too restless to stay
I have learned to travel alone <|endoftext|> 
In the middle of winter
I hear the birds chirping
I am going in January
Go outside without a coat

In the middle of winter
Everyone lays an egg
And even though there are no cows in the pasture at all
It's always spring
Always spring in me

Even though it rains with baking
Even if it storms in the autumn
December is freezing
Even if it is still such a white Christmas

Even though it is all saints
For me it is May
There is only 1 season
And that will never pass
It's always spring
Always spring in me



refr .:
    It is May in me
    Spring is always in me
    It is May in me
    Spring is always in me
    It will never end
    Spring is always in me

Even if there is a depression
From the north to us
Even though life is meaningless
They don't get me tired of life

Even though all the sharks in the world like me raw
Even though I am ashamed red and even more annoyed to be blue
It's always spring
Always spring in me

How it was in hell
And she looks at the ground
Until I don't ask any more questions

Then she laughs and says
Let us sing and dance
Because the future is open
And the world is changing

And when I ask how it was
In the year of the dog
Then the end of the world
In the spring began

Then she looks at me, and she says
Let us go
Because we live today
And nothing lasts

The herd is grazing
Everything is fine
They slowly fill their stomachs
Until daylight flees

The shepherd has disappeared
For a while or forever
There is no one to show the way
There is no one to keep them

Poor sheep
Hear them bellow
So awful alone
Poor sheep
Left alone

Poor sheep
Hear them bellow
All alone together
Poor sheep
You hear them ask
For whom, for what, why,
What, for what, where to

They look to the sky
Nailed to the ground
They are waiting for a miracle
That does not come



Not a shepherd to be seen
Lost in smoke
Only the fearful premonition
Run with them

They belong in thoughts
The wolves in the forest
Even if it is an illusion
It won't let them go

No one in the flock
Who still trusts the other
See, they disowned
Which is strange and old

They are poor sheep
Hear them bellow
So awful alone
Poor sheep
Left alone
Poor sheep
Hear them bellow
All alone together
Poor sheep
You hear them ask
For whom, for what, why,
What, for what, where to

Where does the flock go <|endoftext|>

Always keep dancing
Don't ask her why
She dances until morning comes

She danced around the earth
She danced through time
She saw the world burn
The torches in Berlin
War, madness, walls, dictatorships
She didn't stay anywhere long
Because she wanted to move

I don't want to be the best
Because the best has had the best
I don't want to be the first
Because the first gets caught first

The winner can only lose
The loser can still dream of happiness
I believe in desire
And if you get what you want
Desire is broken

I have enough
Give someone else the power
I am an underdog
I'm feeling good
When no one expects anything from me
Because then everything is still possible
To happen



No, I don't want to be the best
Because being the best is too exhausting
I don't have to be on top of that mountain
Leave me here in the valley among the cows

Just give me last place
Put me in the back of the line
Then no one is chasing me
Then no one gets behind me

I have enough
Give someone else the power
I am an underdog

I see the banners and banners
I see the arrival of the heroes
With the eagles and lions
Painted on their shields
And I hear trumpets sound
Because the grind gives up
And I hear the foot soldiers sing
Because the tournament has started

See the nobleman Zidane
See him walk see him stand
He takes the ball
With one foot on
He holds it
Rotates on its axis
Blind the enemy
Plays it
And let them run
To the moon

And
Duke Van der Sar the first
Man of dignity and tranquility
Watches over its territory
Puts the enemy to flight
And he fights without pretension
More than an hour and a half
And he saves his own army
From Czech purgatory

    When the party is in the ballroom
    It can be so beautiful

    Like the knights and the princes
    Fight
    To win



See the Prince of Portugal
The celebrated Rui Costa
And Duke Figo of Lisboa
Acrobats at the ball
What a beauty, what an insight
What creativity
And what a disappointment for the loser
Who only writes songs

Because see them there in the stands
Watch the men fight
Duchesses of Hispain
Madeiran beautiful girls
Great blonde Viking women
Who love football so much
Oh I just stood there on the grass
I wish I was such a knight

And you knights of Orange
Mat your harness of pretense
Drop that steel mask
That misplaced arrogance
And play with Spanish blood
As you did to the Danes
Chase the ball into the goal
Play the stars of the sky

I only have a piano
And a few cliches
I have a chair to sit on
And a bed for two
I have a lot of stories
Before bedtime
I have an alarm clock that is broken
In order not to get up

I have a bookcase full of books
But I don't know much
I have a room in the basement
From a castle in the air
I have a closet full of clothes
Where the moth is in
And I float like loose teeth
In dentures

Without anything

This last song
I sing alone

Only for you
Only for you

Only for you
It stands or falls

And that is not enough

You are everything I want
You are everything I want
And that is more than enough
That is never too little

We're going into town tonight
And we drink a glass
I will never forget
How it was without you
I put my heart in your hands
So don't squeeze them
We're going right through the night
To the morning light
Because

I want to see everything about you
I want to see everything about you
So tell me your dreams
Which did not materialize
Because I want to see everything about you



And you get everything I have
You get everything I have
My secrets, my words
Which no human should ever hear
You, everything I have

And we go into town
And we drink a glass
I never want to forget
How it was without you
And I crawl into your arms
As small as a child
We're going right through the night
Until the day begins

And we sleep and we dream
While the people like water
Flowing through the streets
On the hunt for the money
That their life is ruining
But we are only getting up
When night falls

Because you are all I have
You are all I have
And that is more than enough
That is never too little
You, everything I have <|endoftext|> 
The very last weeks
The days passed quickly
Farewell comes close
It will be difficult

Say you don't have to go, honey
That you really had enough of me
Say you don't have to go, honey
Go, honey, because you have to
I know you have to

If possible then
I stayed with you one more night
Shall I say I'm waiting for you
And that the future smiles at us
Then I would say for the umpteenth time
I don't want anyone else ever again

The suitcases are already outside
The tailgate slams shut
One last long kiss
In the early morning light



Say you don't have to go, honey
That you really had enough of me
Say you don't have to go, honey
Go, honey, because you have to
I know you have to

If possible then
I stayed with you one more night
If possible then
I stayed with you one more night
Shall I say I'm waiting for you
And that the future smiles at us
Then I would say for the umpteenth time
I don't want anyone else ever again

Never again will I feel what I feel for you
I hope I can live without you
Come on now
Wipe away your tears
And remember very well that I love you
Love you

No no no
You don't have to go baby
No
No no no
You don't have to go baby
No <|endoftext|> 
Appointment here, tennis lesson there
Nothing on hand, the dishes are not ready yet
I still have to go to the bank and to the dry cleaner
I miss the traffic news, queue for hours

One thing I know for sure
They don't drive me crazy
And yet I think every morning
When I leave home

I want free time, nice in front of the TV with a bag of chips
I want free time, with a pipe of lager and that beautiful girl of mine
I want free time, I want more free time for me and my girl

Always school, get there on your old bike
When you are at work, everything must be done immediately
When you finally get home, the phone rings
The laundry basket is full again and your clothes must be clean

One thing I know for sure
They don't drive me crazy
And yet I think every morning
When I leave home



I want free time, nice in front of the TV with a bag of chips
I want free time, with a pipe of lager and that beautiful girl of mine
I want free time, I want more free time for me and my girl

When I wake up I feel so weird
What can I do about it
Yet I always think: "It will be great"
But I don't know how
I'm ready for it

I want free time, ohoohohoohoh
Free time, that's what I want
Free time, I want more free time for me and my girl

I want free time, nice in front of the TV with a bag of chips
I want free time, with a pipe of lager and that beautiful girl of mine
I want free time, I want more free time for me and my girl

I want free time, nice in front of the TV with a bag of chips
I want free time, with a pipe of lager and that beautiful girl of mine
I want free time, I want more free time for me and my girl <|endoftext|> 
Monday morning I go to work with headaches
only after three cups of coffee do I feel okay
went out on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, that's why I'm tired
because during these days I really count for two

When I think about it
freshly squeezed gravy
soft-boiled egg
cheese on a rusk
I always look forward to the weekend

Who knows the weekend, who knows the weekend, not the weekend
eating, dancing, jumping and coming up with something fun together, who doesn't know it
Who knows the weekend, who knows the weekend, not the weekend
drink together, laugh, pin and love each other now who doesn't know it

Friday morning I go to work without any worries
another eight hours of toil then the party starts for me
Friday, Saturday, Sunday I will go out no I am not tired
I haven't been this fit in ages



When I think about it
nothing to my mind
first lie down on the couch
I always look forward to the weekend

Who knows the weekend, who knows the weekend, not the weekend
eating, dancing, jumping and coming up with something fun together, who doesn't know it
Who knows the weekend, who knows the weekend, not the weekend
drink together, laugh, pin and love each other now who doesn't know it

When I think about it
freshly squeezed gravy
hard-boiled egg
cheese on a rusk
I always look forward to the weekend

Ohoohoohyeah
Who does not know the weekend
Who does not know the weekend
Who does not know the weekend
Who does not know it
Who does not know the weekend
Who does not know the weekend
Who does not know the weekend
Who does not know it
Who does not know the weekend
who knows the weekend, the weekend,
the weekend, not the weekend <|endoftext|> 
What have I done, I am so sorry
I didn't take any chances and went for security
A good job, the big money
a bright future but my days are numbered

What have I done, I am so sorry
I did what others wanted me to do all this time
I didn't think, I was too cowardly
I take a shower and wash off the innocence

No laughter, no enjoyment, no partying
has not been lived for one day!



What have I done, I am so sorry
I forgot to live all this time
I had no goal, I never got mad
I really didn't feel like it was going on

No laughter, no enjoyment, no partying
has not been lived for one day!

I've seen the daily grind now
I thought too small and was also numb
I was drowned in the heat of battle
I have to wake up, wake up forever

No laughter, no enjoyment, no partying
has not been lived for one day! <|endoftext|> 
I come from a village
Where the wind always blows
I come from a time
Which no longer exists
I come from a world
From East and from West
The war was far
Far from my bed

I went to a city
Because I wanted to become someone
I was looking for chaos
Because I got out of order
That's how I learned
Can't believe it anymore
Than what I see
What I see with my eyes

Because I'm not following a direction
And I don't follow a road
I don't follow light
And I don't follow a star
I don't follow a leader
And I don't follow a flag
Just still follow
My heart

Was always insecure
But I didn't show it
The criticism I received
I usually earned
Sometimes I held out
Sometimes I surrendered
And the heart has been touched
But it is not broken

Because I'm not following a direction
And I'm not following a road
I don't follow light
And I don't follow a star
I don't follow a leader
And I don't follow a flag
Just still follow
My heart



And I cannot explain it
And I don't know why
But I want to be a river
It flows to the source
And up the mountain
By the time
Dancing in the rain
Always traveling

And I've seen a world
Where love exists
Traces of war
And traces of hatred
The one with his truth
The other are god
They make each other
Broken with love

So I'm not following a direction
And I don't follow a road
Don't follow light
And I don't follow a star
Don't follow a leader
And I don't follow a flag
Just still follow
Still My heart
I still follow my heart (4x) <|endoftext|> 
He's sitting next to her
In front of the Rubens statue
On the Groenplaats
He looks at her
He has known her for almost fifty years now
He suddenly sees his life pass in a flash
The war and the children who have grown up
And he takes her arm and he says

refr .:
    Everything passes
    Everything passes
    Stay with me
    Because everything passes
    Everything passes
    Everything passes
    Stay with me for a long time
    So much passes

He walks next to her
In the shadow of time, the cathedral
And he looks at her
Every wrinkle in her skin has its story
She is more beautiful than he has often wanted to see
He would like to say so much more and it is not too late
So he takes her arm and he says



refr.

I don't regret my life
But was I allowed to do everything again
Then I would spend a lot more time with you
Much more feeling

Number four is bent
With the towel in the neck
The confusion in his eyes
Fighting with himself

Number six is ​​thinking about the cross
Which he didn't give to number eight
Number one rises
Because the interviewer is waiting

Number eleven takes off his shoes
His legs hurt
Number ten, his last game
It shouldn't have been

And the player who didn't play
Looks at a fallen hero
And wonders in silence
Why it was not drafted

Why are the gods
Did not come to our rescue
We weren't meant to be
For the promised land
Why did our ship wreck
When the harbor was already in sight
Or were we not good enough
Which left us stranded



Number three takes off the shirt
What he got from the winner
And the goalkeeper keeps himself strong
He is the only one who still speaks

And the Orange veterans
From the great general
They know what loss is
For twenty-six years

And the trainer on TV
Speaks reports to the nation
And says goodbye with few words
From the penalty kick generation

Number fourteen is running the shower
And puts shampoo in his hair
The city is getting restless
Because defeat is tough

Why are the gods
Did not come to our rescue
We weren't meant to be
For the promised land
Why did our ship wreck
When the harbor was already in sight
Or were we not good enough
Which left us stranded <|endoftext|> 
The end of the eighties
The end of a great time
I will no longer wait for you
I have no regrets, no blame

The last words have been said
On the battlefield of happiness
Because all the things we feel
The confusion breaks it down

And I don't know if I'll miss you
I don't know how it will go now
I am alone
only know
That it couldn't go on like this

Sometimes you don't notice
You talk less to each other
And one day you say nothing more
It is a pity that it often has to be this way



But I don't know if I can miss you
I don't know what to do next
Maybe a trip
Call it a flight
I have to go somewhere with my feeling

Slowly all things will
Do wear out over time
Then I can start again
That's how it always goes, always

But I ... don't know if I can miss you
I don't know what to do next
Maybe another
Call it a flight
I have to go somewhere with my feeling

I don't know if I can miss you
I don't know how it will go now
I am alone
only know
That you persist in my head <|endoftext|> 
I have looked again
To everything around us
I have reconsidered the day

After crowded weeks
No time for us alone
I saw something I never saw before

Come pack your things and let's go
Quick freedom at the back
It's done here

Let's disappear into the night
To where no one is waiting for us
Let's leave without a word
Where no one disturbs us anymore
And nobody hears us anymore

I work alone and eat something
Lost the urge
To everything that gently caresses my ego

But now it's enough honey
Life doesn't last long
I only have your love in the picture



Come pack your things and let's go
Quick freedom at the back
It's done here, done here

Let's disappear into the night
To where no one is waiting for us
Let's leave without a word
Where no one disturbs us anymore
And nobody hears us anymore

I just want to be with you
But I've had it here
So we run, honey
Fast past the horizon

Let's disappear into the night
To where no one is waiting for us
Let's leave without a word
Where no one disturbs us anymore
And nobody hears us anymore

I have looked again
To everything around us
I have reconsidered the day <|endoftext|> 
She is beautiful, like a butterfly in the spring
She is sweet and smiles her teeth
But I feel that my longing for someone else
After a week with her, it again enlarged
I can't help but feel my heart beats for women
Who can tell how it stops

Oh, oh, oh, why now
Oh, oh, oh, through what
I don't want to choose now
And precedes my freedom

She's wild, like the swell of the waves
She is beautiful and has a heart of gold
But I still feel, I still feel the desire
To a life that does not oppress me
I can't help it, my feelings play up
Who can tell how it stops



Oh, oh, oh, why now
Oh, oh, oh, through what
I don't want to choose now
And precedes my freedom

Someone who can do differently
Who mans only one woman
Someone who knows otherwise
Help me out

Oh, oh, oh, why now
Oh, oh, oh, through what
I don't want to choose now
And precedes my freedom

Oh, oh, oh, why now
Oh, oh, oh, through what
I don't want to choose now
And precedes my freedom <|endoftext|> 
My lips so close to your mouth, my hands
so close, you couldn't resist
The lights danced around us,
my fingers slid down your leg
I lit you.

You looked at me and pulled me along
you wanted to be alone with the two of you
during the night.
Are we on the way after you
and nothing to stop us anymore
You look and you smile.
It is impossible to imagine we are now walking in.

Turn off all the lights and close the doors
and ask me to stay with you tonight.
Take off all your clothes and then come to me baby
your body is so soft (2x)

My hands so close to your mouth, my lips like this
close, you can't resist me.
The candles burn around us
my fingers slide down your leg, I'll light you
It's unbelievable,
we are now walking upstairs



Turn off all lights and close all doors
and ask me to stay with you tonight.
Take off all your clothes
and then come to me baby
your body is so soft (2x)

I immediately felt that you were so different.
Get close to me
and hold me forever (3x)

Turn off all lights and close all doors
and ask me to stay with you tonight.
Take off all your clothes
and then come to me baby
your body is so soft (2x)

Turn off all lights and close all doors
and ask me to stay with you tonight.
Take off all your clothes
and then come to me baby

So soft, so soft, tonight ... <|endoftext|> 
he's looking for a stick
to play with
does not go to school
like so many
he walks barefoot through the sand
with his little sister crying by his hand
where did he end up?

she is looking for a branch
to wipe with
lives in a house
of stones found
she has been malnourished all her life
and how old she is she does not know very well

and suddenly there comes that smile
because they live by the day
they are not led by their suffering
they see everything relatively
because life is dear to them
they keep their hearts from failing

he is looking for some wood to sell
has to walk for hours on land
he hopes it will rain today
and whether the harvest will make it is still the question



and suddenly there comes that smile
because they live by the day
they are not led by their suffering
they see everything relatively
because life is dear to them
that is something we sometimes forget

we lost it (4x)
relativity

and where does that smile remain with us
he is getting less every day
we forget what it's all about
find the child in yourself again
see life as a game
and make sure it doesn't just blow over
life is dungeonized (2x) <|endoftext|> 
Looks like I'm fine
But deep down it hurts
I am happy but meanwhile
I can no longer be myself

I taste the smoke, I smell the rubbish dump
Dirty streets around me
A woman despondently catches up with her laundry
For a house of blackened stone

I'm really fed up with it
I want some fresh air
I can't take it anymore
And so take flight

Back to nature
Untouched woman
Clear blue sea
Back to nature
Live in the wild
Quiet for two

I am wandering through the busy city
With a thousand people through an alley
I am happy but meanwhile
My head has been empty for weeks

I have no spirit, I no longer feel the power
What I need is air
I can't take it anymore
And so take flight



Back to nature
Untouched woman
Clear blue sea
Back to nature
Live in the wild
Quiet for two

No, I can't take it anymore
The urge for silence in the night
The wind and water give strength

Back to nature
Untouched woman
Clear blue sea
Back to nature
Live in the wild
Quiet for two

Back to nature
Untouched woman
Clear blue sea
Oehohoehohohoehoh
Quiet for two
Untouched woman
Clear blue sea

Back to nature

I want to get back to nature
I want to get back to nature <|endoftext|> 
A thousand shards on the ground
A dry silence around me
The taste of tears in my mouth
I suddenly stand
Only
Cards are flying around
And fall open next to me
Where there was just a house of love
Is now suddenly
Nothing anymore
Yesterday never seems to have happened
The future is gone forever
But in the void around my heart
I feel very crazy
Still free

Hmmmmm hmmmmm
Hmmmmm hmmmmm
Hmmmmm hmmmmm
Naaaa na na na

A thousand words say nothing
You're a stranger to me now
But in the void you hit
I feel very crazy
Liberated



Rather
The truth
Then a lie
Which seems beautiful
What would you choose
If you could choose
Between knowing
And forget

A thousand shards on the ground
A long breath, deep sigh
For all the beauty that disappears
Will come something nicer
Back <|endoftext|> 
No need to be together
No more need to be together

Time seemed to pass quickly
But it turned out to be standing still for ages
Without feeling real
We dragged ourselves on

No need to be together
No more need to be together



The truth has us in its power
And there is nothing to soften it
We were never warned
We were never told

It is not necessary to be together
No more need to be together

No need to be together
No more need to be together

No need to be together
No more need to be together <|endoftext|> 
Just hold me
With all your tears
You don't always have to
To be the strongest
Just be yourself
Don't be ashamed
I'm just that little

And give it a little time
Everything will be fine
As it should be
You won't lose me
You don't have to immediately
To be a butterfly
Give it a little time



And even though sometimes the road seems to go nowhere
He's leading somewhere
You seem to be completely on your own
You are not alone
You just attract your problems
Because you have to get through it
Just like everyone else

Give it a little time
Everything will be fine
As it should be
You don't have to immediately
To be a butterfly
You won't lose me
So give it a little time <|endoftext|> 
Marco:
Whenever I see you walking
Then the sky opens a little bit
Stars, you let them fade
With your eyes that always shine
You can let the sun shine
Because you walk by
And the clouds disappear
And when you smile
The whole world laughs along

Most dreams are deceit
But when I wake up next to you
Then I still dream
I feel your breath and see your face
You are a dream that lies next to me
You look at me and stretch
Once in a while dreams come true

Ali B & Yes-r:
Listen my love for you this ode
Don't you know you're the woman of my dreams
I love your smile and I love your eyes
You belong to me you can hardly believe
Everything I have wished for has come true
You never shut out my love
You have never sucked things out of your thumb
With you by my side I am free as a bird
I am grateful every day
When you lie in my bed I approach you slowly
Put my arm around you and I smile
Stay with me I show you my willpower
---------------------------------
Yet my love is crystal clear
Clear as crystal
Clear as crystal
You know that I am very often busy
Far from home but happy when I get back
Because of you dear the world opens up for me
Want you to know and you have to believe me
Now take my hand and look into my eyes
You're the one who stole my heart
Sometimes the sun shines and it is cold in winter
But because of you I feel the butterflies every day again
So come with me and believe in my words
Believe me when I say we belong together
Look at me and relax
I am your husband so what then I am ready for you
No fear darling yo just get it out of you
You're my diamond in the rough and my dove dove
I want you as my bride
Are dreams really a fraud?
Marco explain it to them!

You have to promise me one thing
Make me believe in my dreams for a long time to come
Even if you are not here for a while
Then stay with me in my sleep
And when the sun starts to shine again
Then don't let that image that I have disappear
If you went
You take my dreams with you

Most dreams are deceit
But when I wake up next to you
Then I still dream
I feel your breath and see your face
You are a dream that lies next to me
You look at me and stretch
Once in a while dreams come true



You can let the sun shine
Because you walk by and the clouds disappear
And when you laugh, the whole world laughs along

Most dreams are deceit
But when I wake up next to you
Then I still dream
I feel your breath and see your face
You are a dream that lies next to me
You look at me and stretch
Once in a while dreams come true

You look at me and stretch
Once in a while dreams come true

Most dreams are deceit
But when I wake up next to you
Then I still dream
I feel your breath and see your face
You are a dream that lies next to me
You look at me and stretch
Once in a while dreams come true

Hello heart ...
I haven't felt you for a long time
but you're back (hey yé)
A long night, washed away all my tears so go ahead (hey yé)
Because something beautiful has happened
she has colored my life
Hello heart, here I am again.

Today a new day begins,
I see the sun again (hey yé)
the night disappeared when I saw her
no clouds for the moon.
They are gone forever.

She took me, I had no idea
I was lost in the dark and tired
and she brought me right back to you
and I'm back ... Yes I'm back.



Hello heart ...
I've been gone for a while
but i'm home again.
(nanananana)
The night disappeared when I saw her
no clouds for the moon.
They've gone forever
and I see the sun ... standing again !! <|endoftext|> 
Open my eyes to a world that no longer offers me anything
Try it every morning but it doesn't change
Her warm hands, sweet smile
Its everything i miss
I want it back
So I'm going quickly to where she is

Let me dream
Let me dream
I don't want to know that anything has changed
So different
Let me dream
Let me dream
Though it becomes light
I just keep my eyes closed



Ten thousand colors in the sky
It is raining tears of happiness
The clouds are dancing
And the sun smiles at the moon
No war, no poverty, no pain
Everything exactly how it should be
And wherever my gaze reaches
I see her standing next to me

Open my eyes to a world that no longer offers me anything
I really tried
But I can't

Let me dream
Let me dream
Even if it will be so light tomorrow
You put the sun on my face
I don't care what is there
I keep them closed <|endoftext|> 
Morning dusk dances over your body
And mirrors in the window
What love can do for a woman.
And I cry while you smile when I caress you gently
In the place where our future is slowly growing.

No, no I never knew
That given a new life to a man and a woman
brings so much power and so much beauty
And you smile when I tell you that you are the most beautiful
and wearing the most beautiful thing I've ever felt

It is coming closer
New life is liberating
And it is yours and mine
A love of life
And all we are is she
A love of life from the strength of you and me

[ohoooow]

Everything I ever wanted to say to you
I don't have to explain anymore
The past no longer has a future
And I cry while you say what I once did to you
your love for a man
has never affected me

It is coming closer
New life is liberating
And it is yours and mine
A love of life
And everything we are is so pristine and small
A love of life
From the power of you and me



It is coming closer
New life is liberating
And it is yours and mine
A love of life
And all we are is she
A love of life
From the power of you and me

And your body speaks a language
that I have never heard
But I understand it all
I understand word for word
And we laugh and we cry
Of that life deep within you
The power it gives us
Brings us closer together more than ever

[oooh]

It is coming closer
New life is liberating
And it is yours and mine
A love of life
And everything we are is so pristine and small
A love of life
From the power of you and me

It is coming closer
New life is liberating
And it is yours and mine
A love of life
And all we are is she
A love of life
From the power of you and me

It is coming closer
New life is liberating
And it is yours and mine
A love for life .... <|endoftext|> 
Close your eyes for a second
put a smile on your face
say thank you to life
for love and light
make a wish for someone else,
even if it seems so small and quiet
every wave starts as a ripple
but always makes a difference

Celebrate the life around you
hang up the streamers and dance with everyone
Life is too short already
yes, and only is only alone
So dream, dare, do and share with everyone

Share your wealth with someone else
love, much more than gold
and be kind to who you love
say if you love someone
give a smile to a stranger
hug someone every day
and be grateful for the things you are allowed to experience today

Celebrate the life around you
hang up the streamers and dance with everyone
Life is too short already
yes, and only is only alone
So dream, dare, do and share with everyone

Watch the waves and see the sea
Look at all the people around you
Just take my hand and I'll take you
because together we can, together, more than one

Close your eyes for a second
put a smile on your face
enjoy the dark for a while, it will automatically become light again



Take the hand of someone next to you
Doesn't matter if you know them
Everyone is equally welcome
as long as you are yourself
Now throw your hands into the air
fill your heart with hope and pride
Now open your eyes again
see the forest through the trees

Celebrate life around you
hang up the streamers and dance with everyone
Life is too short already
yes, and only is only alone
So share your heart with everyone around you
Don't be alone

Dream, dare, do and share with everyone

Close your eyes tonight
with a smile on your face
Just be thankful for life
as it now lies before you. <|endoftext|> 
Whenever I see you walking
then the sky opens a little bit.
Stars, you let them fade
with your eyes always shining.

You can let the sun shine
because you walk by and the clouds disappear
and when you smile, the whole world laughs along.

Most dreams are deceit
but when I wake up next to you I'm still dreaming.
I feel your breath and see your face
you are a dream lying next to me.
You look at me and stretch
once in a while dreams come true!

You have to promise me one thing
let me believe in my dreams for a long time to come.
Even if you are not here for a while
then stay with me in my sleep.

And when the sun starts to shine again
then don't let that image that I have disappear.
If you were to go take my dreams with you.



Most dreams are deceit
but when I wake up next to you I'm still dreaming.
I feel your breath and see your face
you are a dream lying next to me.
You look at me and stretch
once in a while dreams come true!

Ooh you can make the sun shine
because you walk by and the clouds disappear.
And when you smile, the whole world laughs along.

Most dreams are deceit
but when I wake up next to you I'm still dreaming.
I feel your breath and see your face
you are a dream lying next to me.
You look at me and stretch
once in a while dreams come true!

You look at me and stretch
once in a while dreams come true!

Most dreams are deceit
but when I wake up next to you I'm still dreaming.
I feel your breath and see your face
you are a dream lying next to me.
You look at me and stretch
once in a while dreams come true! <|endoftext|> 
Gentle as a breeze
It rustles through the trees
My lips form your name
And I think of you

Every night
I see you in my dreams
And then whisper close to your mouth
how much I love you

Oh yes I do know that you are not free
But I'll wait for you to be mine

Domenica

Some day
Then you will listen to me
And then you will understand that we
Are made for each other

Until that day
I will only whisper
I'm waiting for a sign from you
A look or a gesture



Oh yes I know
That you are not free
But I have patience
And I'll wait until
You are mine

I dream of us here
In the dark
I see your face
And in my head
sounds our whispers

Domenica
Domenica

Oh yes I know
That you are not free
But I have patience
And I'll wait until
You are mine

I wait for you
Even if it takes ages
I whisper your name
But the day will come
That I'll shout to him

Domenica
Domenica <|endoftext|> 
I had everything done
The whole book was out and I was done
Then you walked into my life
Minus became plus and plus became minus

By you
My whole life has been turned upside down
And without you I will never recover
I don't know myself anymore
And nothing is familiar yet
That all comes
By you

Build a wall brick by brick
I thought everything was right, but that was wrong
Home was safe, nice alone
But you walked right through everything



By you
My whole life has been turned upside down
And without you I will never recover
I don't know myself anymore
And nothing is familiar yet
That all comes

By you
Are all nights light
Even with my eyes closed
Everything that was dark
has left
I see the stars again
Because there are no more clouds
They have left
When I saw you standing there

By you
My whole life has been turned upside down
And without you I will never recover
I don't know myself anymore
And nothing is familiar yet
That all comes
By you <|endoftext|> 
I wipe the tears from my face
you still have your eyes closed.
I could watch for hours
how you lie in front of me now.
you always lived by the day,
but lately when i saw you
you didn't feel like laughing anymore
I wondered why.

because that's life
happiness and sadness.
it was given to you
but you didn't want to.
are you happy now
or are you sorry now?
do you miss the years we were together
because that was a great time!

I wonder where or where you are now.
and if I knew you.
because something in you that I couldn't reach
is never used to this life.
could you count on me a little more
and I would have been closer to you.
could I have told you something
so you might not have done this.

because this was your life
happiness and sadness.
it was given to you
but you didn't want to.
are you happy,
or are you sorry now?
do you miss the years we were together?
because that was a great time, right ?!



if you could choose where to go,
would you come back here or far from here.

this was your life,
happiness and sadness.
it was given to you
but you didn't want to.
are you happy,
or are you sorry now?
do you miss the years we were together
because that was a good time, right?

this was your life,
here you were at home
where have you been,
so far from home.
are you sad,
or are you liberated?
and were the years we were together just a waste of time?

anyway you lost everything. <|endoftext|> 
I thought I could trust you
I was mainly thinking about you
You have to build on real love
So what do you make me
You just walk away
Just away without fighting

Well if you think you can run
I say your flights don't help anymore
You have the most to fear from yourself
Time after time
You just walk away, just walk away
If it gets too difficult, you have already left

I didn't deserve this (2x)
No you really can't make this
I didn't deserve this (2x)
No you really can't make this



You will have to choose once
Not for the easiest way
It's not about winning or losing
But because of what your heart tells you
So go away, go away again
If it gets too difficult, you have already left

I didn't deserve this (2x)
No you really can't make this
I didn't deserve this (2x)
No you really can't make this
I didn't deserve this (2x)

Of course there is always a new beginning
And you are always someone else
But if you go I don't have to see you again
Then I'm sure you don't deserve me

I didn't deserve this (2x)
No you really can't make this
I didn't deserve this (2x)
No you really can't make this
I didn't deserve this (2x)
no no no no
No you really can't make this
I didn't deserve this (2x) <|endoftext|> 
Arm's length, but miles away from me
Did I go to sleep too early, or did you turn off the light?
Let me find you, give me the chance to start over
Let me see you, let me love you again
I'm looking for you in the dark, why don't I see you
Why aren't you here, give me something, a sign of life
A single flame, something so I can see which direction it came from
A little light my dear, it is now on its way back to you

When you dream of love, with a kiss for the silence ahead
I want to break her through so badly, but that won't work if you hide
Let yourself be heard, let your sorrow pierce all my heart
I can't have lost you, I'm calling for you in the dark
Why don't you answer why aren't you there
Give me something, a sign of life
A single sound so I can determine which way is forward
A signal that tells me you still trust me somewhere
I want to try everything, but I can't do it alone
I want to go everywhere, but I don't know where
A single note dear, show me the way back, I want to go back so badly



Arm's length, but miles away from me
Let me feel you, let those my mistakes so cool in your heart
Let our love engulf our fear
I'm looking for you in the dark, why don't I see you
Why aren't you here, give me something a sign of life
That you are still there, something of yours from the past, something that I recognize
Proof that tells me that somewhere you still love me so much

I want to try everything, but it won't work alone
I want to go anywhere if you tell me where
Please help show me the way back
I want so badly back to you <|endoftext|> 
Can anyone tell me
when a shooter rests,
when the arc is allowed to relax
his arrow kisses the last target

When is a person satisfied?
he notices for once when he looks
over the fence at the neighbors
that the grass doesn't look just a little greener



Tell me where to look
and what is that wish
after which we don't have to go any further
where and when is the limit

And why do I want to continue
when I'm somewhere
what makes the unknown better
than anything I know

And why am I never completely happy
with what belongs to me
Why does something have to be added again and again?
Why never once
a little less than more
When does that desire set me free? <|endoftext|> 
I think about what you feel
I think about how you smile
I think about all that love
That you gave to me
And what you expect
What you think of me
And how you live for me
I avoid your eyes
If they want to understand me
Whenever they look at me
I just miss them
When you stand in front of me
I keep running into your arms
So that I cannot betray
What the truth is
You tell me every day
How much you love me
How nice you live in security
How you trust me

Chorus:
How do you tell someone
That the earth is no longer round
That the birds no longer fly
And the sun no longer shines
How do I tell you
That the life you lived
And the love you felt
Soon disappears
You lose me



You lose me
It's the truth

Chorus

The truth <|endoftext|> 
Do what you always did
when I was there.
Live every day to the fullest,
and with all your heart.

And you find me
and you feel me.
I am close to you
miss me.

It's OK.,
because I miss you so much.

Cry if you have to cry
let go of your tears.
But if you can smile again
don't hold back from me.

Because I feel you
I experience everything with you.
I am close to you
watch over you.
And if you're looking for me
I am always there.



Please enjoy if you can,
every day for me.
Cherish every moment
It will be over in a minute.

Jump, laugh and dance like a child
put the shame aside.
Don't do it alone
open your heart again.
Even though it feels strange
you do it for me too

Singing out loud,
chase your dreams.
And know whatever you will do
that I'm behind you.

Because I feel you
I experience everything with you.
I am close to you
watch over you.
And if you are looking for me I am always there

Do what you always did <|endoftext|> 
Hahahahahaaaaaaaaaah
Hahahahahaaaaaaaaaah

Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you

The door opens
And there you stand in front of me
You're not a stranger
But you were never close

I read something in your eyes
That I don't expect
And I see you smile
The way you never smile at me
And I have forgotten
How I actually know you
I just want to know
What you feel about me now
And that you are with me
And in one second
Are you really that close

I can feel your lips
Gentle on mine
The world outside
Completely passes us by
With my eyes open
I dream this night
And I am sure
I've waited for you all my life

I don't want to know more
What the morning will bring
I don't care anymore
Because now I'm here with you
Only in this moment
And in one second
Are you really that close

So close
You're so close
Bee
I can see the tears in your eyes
And a thousand rainbows
Your heart feels like mine
All your love, all your pain
So close
You're so close
Bee



I whisper in your ear
That I belong with you forever
And what does that come
We can manage that together
Because together we are so close
So close
So close

Hoeeeeeeeeeewuuuuuh
So close
So close

I see your tears in your eyes
And a thousand rainbows
Your heart feels like mine
All your love, all your pain
You're so close
So close

And I scream it in your ear
That I belong with you forever
And what does that come
We can manage that together
Because together we are so close
So close
So close

Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Hoeeeeeeeeeewuuuuuh
Close to you
Close to you
Hoeeeeeeeeeewuuuuuh
Close to you
Close to you
Hoeeeeeeeeeewuuuuuh
Close to you
Close to you
Hoeeeeeeeeeewuuuuuh
Close to you
Close to you
Hoeeeeeeeeeewuuuuuh
Close to you
Close to you
Hoeeeeeeeeeewuuuuuh
Close to you
Close to you
Hoeeeeeeeeeewuuuuuh
Close to you
Close to you
Hoeeeeeeeeeewuuuuuh
Close to you
Close to you

The door opens
There you are in front of me

Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you <|endoftext|> 
Quarter past seven on Sunday morning
I hear a voice asking me very softly
Are you awake yet, Dad?
Are you coming down with us?
Do you have to work or are you free today?
And will you go out with me for a moment?

Ohhh, time flies
I saw her for the first time yesterday, she was lying here in my arms
How beautiful she is and how good time suits her
I blink my eyes and see how she has changed a bit over and over again
But however big it may be
In my eyes she always remains small

Quarter past seven on Sunday morning
I hear the front door open very softly
And I fall asleep, she's at home
I would much rather have picked her up, but she asked me if
I didn't want to stand there
She is now finding her way home



And ohh, time flies
I saw her for the first time yesterday, she was lying here in my arms
How beautiful she is
The time suits her
I blink my eyes and see how she has changed a bit over and over again
But however big it may be
In my eyes she always remains small

And sometimes when I close my eyes
We walk together on the beach
Her hand in mine
And then, she stops time for a moment
Is it just like then
And does she need me again
I hold her
As she was
I hold her

Quarter past seven on Sunday morning
She hears my voice waking her gently
Today is your big day

How beautiful she is and how good time suits her
I blink my eyes and see how her heart now belongs to someone else forever
But wherever she may be
In my mind she is here with me
In my eyes she always remains small <|endoftext|> 
Think of me
wherever life takes you
and feel free
if you think it is better this way
then follow your heart, even if it hurts
i will always be there for you
wherever you think of me
choices have been made
you took them for me too
there's nothing holding us together now
all those years were so familiar
but this life together passes us by

it is difficult to understand
and it cannot be explained
that you care about someone so much
and still have to go your own way
I can't give you anymore now
than the freedom in your life
why should a human be so necessary
stand on its own two feet
you set yourself free
wherever life takes you



think of me
spread your wings, darling, take your time
even if it will take forever
if you stay now you will definitely regret it
I prefer you somewhere else
thinks of me
and know that I love you
and that I think somewhere
to you

no you can't understand
and it cannot be explained
that you care about someone so much
and still have to go your own way
I didn't want to lose you
but I can't choose you
and I can't tell you which way to take
so free yourself
and wherever life takes you
think of me
know that I love you
and that I always think about you somewhere <|endoftext|> 
The dusk
black clouds in the sky
just the wind that talks to me

And the trees, they dance
the cold cuts into my hands
as the evening stares at me

And my cold hands are full of calluses
my broken heart hasn't healed yet
but i finally wake up with a focking hangover
my transcode is soaked in water
the stars in the sky tell me
that I will always live in uncertainty
but uncertainty is the only certainty for me
suddenly people fall off their pedestal
don't walk from anywhere, but straight for it
negativity is punished here
and idlers are barked at
i am a painting
in red white blue
in the focking cold
and yes i find myself focking lukewarm
because at least I really care about you

The dusk
black clouds in the sky
just the wind that talks to me

And the trees, they dance
the cold cuts into my hands
as the evening stares at me



Come and stand next to me
get lost with me
you take less and give yourself dignity
talk to me or shut up
but never let me be the last
so many rules, nothing that is required
so many differences with the same blood
so many ambitions around the corner
so your last glances come to the silver screen
do not look back
walk with my face towards the sun
and never forget where I come from
always look over the horizon
you are a friend of mine
runs through the snow when it freezes with me
I chose you
you choose me
the dusk

The dusk
black clouds in the sky
just the wind that talks to me

And the trees, they dance
the cold cuts into my hands
as the evening stares at me

It may rain from me
let it thunder
sometimes I prefer to feel alone
and I can't be with you
but certainly not without you
sometimes I don't need anyone around me

The dusk
black clouds in the sky
just the wind that talks to me

And the trees, they dance
the cold cuts into my hands
as the evening stares at me <|endoftext|> 
Through blown up streets
without a father, without a country
you walk helplessly left
to your mother's warm hand
Like a sheep among wolves
the destination unknown
and no one sees how small you are
no one sees how small you are

Tomorrow there will be peace
the sun will caress you
the world will be a playground again
and you can play quietly



After winter comes spring
the gray sky turns blue again
but even if you are out of the war
will the war ever get out of you?

Beautiful eyes are poisoned
are used to the violence
and no one sees how small you are
no one sees how small you are <|endoftext|> 
I'm imprisoned every night
In the threads of your web
Where I have to hang still
Until I never feel homesick again
But I still see the shapes
From your lips to my glass
And your body is still in the mattress

Tie my hands along my sides
And then I still hold you
Put a blindfold over my eyes
And I find you by touch
Deaf both my ears
And I will hear what you say

I am the loser
The loser
Loser in an uneven fight

I am chained every night
On a chain of loss
And I'm not allowed to move
Until the pain subsides

There are shards in the room
Of our lives on the ground
And I still taste your tears
In my mouth



Tie my hands along my sides
And then I still hold you
Put a blindfold over my eyes
And I find you by touch
Deaf both my ears
And I will hear what you say

I am the loser
The loser
Loser in an uneven fight

You chase me where I go
Wherever I am wherever I am
You are the shadow behind me
Every second of the day
I hear your voice
I see your smile
When will you release my heart?

Oh, I would like to run
But there is no point in escaping
Because eventually you catch up with me again

Tie my hands along my sides
And then I still hold you
Put a blindfold over my eyes
And I find you by touch
Deaf both my ears
And I will hear what you say

I am the loser
The loser
Loser in an uneven fight <|endoftext|> 
I am a fool like so many
Caught in my own trap
The glass cage of my thoughts
Where I will spend this life <|endoftext|> 
I never have you alone
you share your sweet heart with everyone
so free
but you love me

You are there and you are not there
so many things where you see something
next to me
and that's exactly why I love you so much

Because that's you
that's you
Yes that is you
that's you
you follow your own path
are who you are
and really
you make my heart so happy
Yes that is you
that's you

You come when you come and you go when you go
but I'm sure you'll come sooner or later
passed me by

And just when I think I know you
is it as if you are just different
for me
and that's exactly why I love you so much

Because that's you
that's you
Yes that is you
that's you
you follow your own path
are who you are
and really
you make my heart so happy
Yes that is you
that's you



I can watch you for hours
without ever seeing me
I enjoy when I see you enjoying

Naaa naaa na na na na naaaaaa

Yes that is you
that's you
Yes that is you
that's you

You follow your own path
are who you are
and really
you make my heart so happy
Yes that is you
that's you

that's you
that's you
you follow your own path
does what you say
and really
you suit me so well
Yes that is you
that's you <|endoftext|> 
When the sheet slips off your body
My world stops for a moment
And if you tempt my heart asleep yourself.
Love is getting too much for me.

Love me and bring your whole body closer.
And feel my hands pass you by.
As long as the night lasts I'm yours
Because I love you so much.

When the candlelight falls on your hips
And you look at me sideways
With a look that paralyzes even my soul.
Can't resist you anymore.



Love me and bring your whole body closer.
And feel my hands pass by you.
As long as the night lasts I'm yours
Because I love you so much,

I can stay with you all my life
I want to be here with you forever, be with you.

Believe me, understand me, the love I feel is unbearable
Set me free and give yourself tonight
love me because i love you so much. <|endoftext|> 
Don't look over your shoulder
What has been, leave you alone
We can build our future
Feel the sunlight kiss your cheeks

Don't be afraid of your past
Don't be ashamed of that time
Just hold on to the present
You can have pain, but don't have any regrets

I see in your eyes through your tears
how banished all your love is
You are sure it will not work
Believe me darling, you are wrong

Don't look over your shoulder
Don't blame yourself
Now you are wiser, now you are older
Now that you are with me there is no struggle



Through your tears I can see in your eyes
how your passion has been oppressed for years
how you gave up all hope
But I promise you it will work this time

I see in your eyes through your tears
how banished all your love is
You are sure it will not work
Believe me darling, you're wrong
You're wrong

Don't look over your shoulder
What has been, leave you alone
We can build our future
Feel my body kiss yours

Don't look over your shoulder
Don't blame yourself
Now you are wiser, now you are older
You can win the time…. <|endoftext|> 
I get butterflies in my stomach when I see you
if you look at me I will go crazy
I get butterflies in my stomach when I see you
When your hips turn, my heart races

When I look at you, the world stops for a moment
when i look at you i know what i want

take me with you, take me with you
take me to dreamland, take me
take me with you, take me with you
take me to dreamland then i'll put everything aside
when I see you
hmhmhmhmhm ohoehohoh

I scream from the rooftops when I see you
I've been confused about you for days
I scream from the rooftops when I see you, ohohohoehoh
when you smile at me i'm on fire



When I look at you, the world stops for a moment
when i look at you i know what i want

take me with you, take me with you
take me to dreamland, take me
take me with you, take me with you
take me to dreamland then i'll put everything aside
when I see you

Last round, you already grab your coat
I only take another sip from my almost empty glass
this was it for tonight
you give me another smile
you wave me goodbye at the door, ohhooh

take me with you, take me with you
take me to dreamland, take me
take me with you, take me with you
take me to dreamland then i'll put everything aside
when I see you

oh, take me, take me, mmahah
take me to dreamland, take me
take me with you, take me with you
take me to dreamland then i'll put everything aside
when I see you <|endoftext|> 
Let me one more time
Give you a kiss
Before we go to sleep
Again
See how beautiful you are
Give me another look
Who will follow me in my dreams
And give me another laugh
Who no one else knows

My heart is surrounded
With love for you
I find back with you
Which I love so much
I find peace
When you kiss me



Then take it again
My head in your hands
Before we go to sleep
Again
I let go
Look at me again
Deep in my eyes
Before I turn off the light
Again
Lovingly to

My heart is surrounded
With love for you
I find back with you
Which I love so much
I find peace
When you kiss me
The love for you
Anchored in me
Life flies by in a second
I feel good
As long as I can be with you

Can be with you
My heart is surrounded
With love for you
I find you back
Which I love so much
I find peace
When you kiss me
The love for you
Anchored in me
Life flies by in a second
I feel good
As long as I can be with you
Tell me again
That you love me
Before we go to sleep
Again
That you love me <|endoftext|> 
Oh dear father, please don't drink anymore
I've asked so many times
Because Moesjelief cries again and again
Oh dear father, please don't drink anymore.

A mother sits still at the stove
Her child is sadly standing at the window
Because father is still not at home
Because he's drowning weekly wages
Then suddenly the child runs through the cold
And hears father's voice in a pub
It timidly grabs him by the sleeve
And then asks in a trembling voice

Refr.



The man pushes the child away
That falls to the ground with a smack
Then he sees with fear to his punishment
The head is bleeding wound
Full of shame he then brings his child
Back to his house and his wife
While she connects the head
Father says with deep sorrow

Your dear father doesn't drink anymore
You've asked so many times
So sweetheart, don't come cry no more
Because dear father, he no longer drinks

So sweetheart, don't come cry no more
Because dear father doesn't drink anymore ... <|endoftext|> 
I'm lying on my back in the grass
And behold the moon
I ask her if she knows
Why we exist
Why we are born
And soon go again
But she is silent
And looks at me smiling

Chorus:
Show me
What I live for
Make me feel
What I give
Just a moment so I know
That everything is not in vain
That everything is not for nothing
Been

You can create and define your own rules
You are free in that
The game begins and it is given that it ends
But that's it
There is no guilt, but every step has consequences
For everyone
And yet you play this game
Only



Oh I just can't comprehend
Where and why I am here
Looking for an answer
To a question that nobody knows
Oh I want to play this game
But how should that be done
If I don't know what the purpose is
Do I have to believe blindly
That it has its reason
That no one can tell me
Why I live this life
And that everything here comes down to
To rely on
And that I just miss that feeling

Chorus <|endoftext|> 
Already in the city of Vienna,
yes in that big city
there has a young soldier
had so much fun
there has a young soldier
had so much fun

He wanted to desert
he did it for his Mien
to speak to her again
to see her again

But oh how terribly that hit
when suddenly the guard came
they caught him
and taken to the scaffold

The soldier had to die now
had to die now death
there was no mercy for him
the king who commanded it

His treasure went to the king
release my soldier
I want him forever
forever with me

I will give you four riddles
and if you guess it
are you still this morning
forever with your soldier



Tell me what is a king
a king without a country
tell me what's the water
the water without sand

The king on a playing card
is a king without a country
The tears in my eyes
are the water without sand

Tell me what's the key
that fits on all locks
tell me what is a mirror
a mirror without glass?

The money is the key
that fits on all locks
a heart full of true love
is a mirror without glass

The soldier was given mercy
The soldier was pardoned
because the sweet girl
who could guess riddles

thus she saved her sweetheart
already from certain death
wasn't that true love
that the girl offered him <|endoftext|> 
Falling through the windows
More and more questions in the room
Between cold sheets
I lie alone for hours
And I just wanted to tell you
That I love you so much
But you are no longer there to hear me
And slowly I fall from the world
She no longer suits me
The only one that suits me is you <|endoftext|> 
Live, Live!
Take a look with those eyes in your face
see how freedom is at your feet,
but you don't do anything because you don't dare.
Are you dissatisfied in a fixed place,
feel the challenge pulling you,
but you don't do anything because you don't dare.

I took part in it myself, but the future left me alone.

Live!
Feel the freedom flow into you, let the joy emerge.
Live!
Let joy reign, let fate turn to you.

The day tastes bad in your mouth,
happiness is in the street in front of you on the ground,
but you don't do anything because you don't dare.
Week in, week out of the same rut,
discharge is waiting at the front door,
But you don't do anything, because you don't dare.
I participated in it myself,
but the future left me alone.



Live!
Feel the freedom flow into you, let the joy emerge.
Live!
Let joy reign, feel fate turning to you.

No, you don't have two lives, you really can't do it again.
So you have to give it your all
oh if only, oh if only I knew, oh if only I could,
Stop!

Live! (2x)

Live!
Feel the freedom flow into you, let the joy emerge.
Live!
Let joy reign, feel fate turning to you.

Live! <|endoftext|> 
Let me one more time
Give you a kiss before we go to sleep
See once more how beautiful you are

Give me 1 more look
Who will follow me in my dreams and
give me 1 more smile that no one else knows

My heart is surrounded with love for you
With you I find what I love so much
I find peace when you kiss me

Then take 1 more time
My head in your hands before we go to sleep
1 more time I let myself go

Look at me 1 more time
Deep in my eyes before I turn off the light
1 x Love full on



My heart is surrounded with love for you
With you I find what I love so much
I find peace when you kiss me

My love for you is anchored in me
Life flies by in a second
I feel good as long as I can be there
Can be with you ....

My heart is surrounded with love for you
With you I find what I love so much
I find peace when you kiss me
Kiss me .....

My love for you is anchored in me
Life flies by in a second
I feel good as long as I can be there
Can be with you ....

Tell me 1 more time
That you love me before we go to sleep
1 more time that you love me

I saw children in the snow
At the end of the century
In a country torn apart by two thoughts
But their tracks were dead
The snow turned red
And their mothers are still waiting now

I saw the madness far from here
And I saw a death river
That flows through all times like a monster
Violence is always blind
I saw a mother and a child
Found in each other's arms

And I would like to sing
About Eternal Love
But I write with my eyes
And I sing what I see ... I sing what I see



I have a husband after thirty years
Without revenge or hatred
Get out of prison one day
And it seemed when I saw him
As if he were an angel
Who was sent to this earth by a god

And suddenly I could sing
About Eternal Love
Because I write with my eyes
And I sing what I see ... I sing what I see

But at the last minute of the year
War is declared again
It's always Christmas somewhere without peace
I wish there was music
Which allowed the world to sleep
And forgive and forget with his eyes closed

I wish I
Always could sing
About eternal love
Because I write with my eyes
And I sing what I see ... I sing what I see <|endoftext|> 
I saw you one day walking in town
I had never had such a wonderful feeling
when you saw me, just looked at me
I only think about you since I succumbed to you

We have been living on the same street for a while
and I have long wanted to tell that my heart is skipping
when you look at me, smile at me for a second
you're the one man i'm always waiting for

No, no, you choose me
she is not a party anyway
no, no, you choose me
with me you feel free
choose me, choose me

They are both so beautiful, I didn't know what I saw
beautiful eyes and a wonderful smile
what do I want, who do I want

I am that one woman who shares her dreams with you
I can give you everything you've always wanted
it's me, I want it
so make me happy



No, no, you choose me
she is not a party anyway
no, no, you choose me
with me you feel free
choose me, choose me

I don't want to be mistaken
so let me see who is the best
show it, show it

I'm a lot more special than that other girl
if you choose me you will lose love
for her there, for her there
I can give you anything, hey

No, no, you choose me
she is not a party anyway
no, no, you choose me
with me you feel free
choose me, choose me

No, no, it's over
he is not a party anyway
no, no, it's over
I'll be free for a while
over, over

No, no, it's over
he is not a party anyway
no, no, it's over
I'll be free for a while
over, over, over
over, over, we happy <|endoftext|> 
If the sun stopped shining
When the light was turned off
If the moonlight disappeared
Would I be in the dark
But I would certainly find you
Find with my eyes closed
Because your smile will blind me
When you smile it becomes light

I want you forever
I really don't ever want to lose you
Don't go, stay here, stay with me
No I don't want you to go
Maybe tomorrow will be too late
So stay with me, ohwoh stay with me

If the Earth didn't turn
In the endless blue
not a day was lost
Because my world revolves around you

I want you forever
I really don't ever want to lose you
Don't go, stay here, stay with me
No I don't want you to go
Maybe tomorrow will be too late
So stay with me, ohwoh stay with me

Because I'm cold
If you love me
then nothing goes wrong anymore
I know you belong with me
And when you're with me
I have the world at my feet

if I didn't hear you again
And the love was over
I was hopelessly lost
so why not stay with me



I want you forever
I really don't ever want to lose you
Don't go, stay here, stay with me
No I don't want you to go
Maybe tomorrow will be too late
So stay with me, ohwoh stay with me <|endoftext|> 
It was half past nine and the alarm went off
I had slept with a nice thing last night
and I smoke her, she was still here
The bathroom door, yes it was still locked
and when the door opened, I was shocked
she said "I want you", well with pleasure

Dark brown curls and a tight ass
white fresh teeth in a sultry mouth
I had done it again, but to my regret
she walked away quickly, because …….

I had gradually lost her name
I had gradually lost her name
I had gradually lost her name



I got up quickly and got dressed
it was time to go to the pub again
would she come again, or was she already gone
Waiting for two hours and she just didn't come
just one more beer, I got fed up with it
and I was fed up, oh what bad luck

Suddenly she came in and she looked at me
you will hardly believe what she said to me
"You come with me, I have plenty of time"
but she gave me a bang because

I had gradually lost her name again
I had gradually lost her name
I had gradually lost her name
I had gradually lost her name
I had gradually lost her name
I had gradually lost her name
I had gradually lost her name
I had gradually lost her name
I had gradually lost her name <|endoftext|> 
I'd drop everything in my life
if you asked me to.
I could put all the love in me
if you asked me to.

Because I loved you before I knew you
and I've been thinking of you since the day
that I was still with my mother.

I could stay with you all my life
if you asked me to.
I'd make you forget all your fearful days
if you asked me to.



'Cause I loved you before I knew you and I was already thinking of you
since the day I was still with my mother.

'Cause I loved you before I knew you and I was already thinking of you

I have the sun on my head
And a hat
I am lying next to an umbrella
I apply factor 5
On my whole body
A beer for fun
On a hot day
A sweaty day
Obsessed with the sun
I laughed when summer started

I jump out of my deckchair
And I take a dip
I swim around calmly
I come out of the water again
And take one last sip
From the glass that was still there
Order a new one
lie down again
look into the sky
and see a beautiful hot air balloon
I laughed when summer started

I am starting to live again
Feel the warmth in my body
I have so much to give
When the mercury rises again

Summer take me with you
Smooth out the waves in the sea
A bright yellow sun,
A sultry warm wind
I smile again when summer starts

And when the day fades
And the night appears
I quickly put on my clothes
it's time
to get together with my friends
to go to town
we walk early in the morning
from the last pub
and see the rising sun
I laughed when summer started



I am starting to live again
Feel the warmth in my body
I have so much to give
When the mercury rises again

Summer take me with you
Smooth the waves in the sea
A bright yellow sun,
A sultry warm wind
I smile again when summer begins

I am starting to live again
Feel the warmth in my body
I have so much to give
When the mercury rises again

Summer take me with you
Smooth the waves in the sea (huh)

Summer take me with you
Smooth the waves in the sea (huh)

Summer take me with you
Smooth the waves in the sea
A bright yellow sun,
A sultry warm wind
I smile again when summer begins <|endoftext|> 
I'll let you, I'll let you go now
We together is now really off the job
I do not know what it is
But damn it hurts
I'll let you be yourself again
Everything else was just appearances

I do not know what it is
But damn it hurts
My world is too small
Not to be with you
Where do I go now
All alone



I'll let you go, I'll let you go now
The two of us, way too shaky and too brittle
I do not know what it is
But damn it hurts
My world is too small
Not to be with you
Where do I go now

It's actually a shame
But I will cut the knot
Slowly it becomes clear to me
That I don't belong to you
I've been sure for days
That I am not mistaken
I know what it is now

But damn it hurts
It hurts, it hurts
But damn it hurts
My world is too small
to not be with you
Where do I go now
All alone
I'll let you, I'll let you go now <|endoftext|> 
You bring love close to me
and you, release all worries
You forget all the sorrow

(Chorus:)
Just give your smile and I'll disappear
In dreams where we are together forever
After nights where we can float timelessly
So that we can experience love endlessly ...

You are more beautiful than you know
and you make up for what I forget
You can move me asleep



Chorus

Ooh, the sky is escaping me Ooh
My heart is running towards you
My head is always with you ...
YOU ... !!!

Chorus 2x

You ... bring love close to me ... <|endoftext|> 
In a bed in a hotel
I think about you again, far from me
I quickly close my eyes
That brings you sweet words closer

And I can't stomach it
That I must miss you so much
Then I quickly close my eyes
And then it will slowly work out

In the car on the road
I see your face in my mind
But in the evening in another bed
I pretend you're in my arms

And I can't stomach it
That I must miss you so much
Then I close my eyes again
And then it will slowly work out
Because I know I'll be watching again soon



In the blue sea, in the blue sea
In the blue sea of ​​your eyes I drown again and again
In the blue sea, in the blue sea
In the blue sea of ​​your eyes I drown again and again

And I still can't stomach it
That I must miss you so much
Then I quickly close my eyes
And then it will slowly work out
Because I know I'll be watching again soon

In the blue sea, in the blue sea
In the blue sea of ​​your eyes I drown again and again
In the blue sea, in the blue sea
In the blue sea of ​​your eyes I drown again and again
In the blue sea, in the blue sea
In the blue sea of ​​your eyes I drown again and again <|endoftext|> 
It was not so bad for me
I had the pressure of two
people at the same time,
nobody likes that.
So I walked away from you
without explaining to you
that I couldn't anymore.

I couldn't take it anymore
that you saw me like this
It got worse every day.

I have so much to explain to you
but i mean if i would say
you belong with me (2x)
I want to share everything with you now
life without you is disappointing
you belong with me (2x)

I understand you don't
understood why I left you here.
Just out of the blue, no one likes that.
Take me back to you
and don't tell me too soon
that you can no longer.



Give my heart space to show
what a woman like you deserves.

I have so much to explain to you
but i mean if i would say
you belong with me (2x)
I want to share everything with you now
life without you is disappointing
you belong with me (2x)

Give me your trust
throw away all your doubts
believe when I tell you.

I have so much to explain to you, but I mean as I would say
you belong with me (2x)
I want to share everything with you now, life without you is disappointing

"Every time you look me in the eye
I almost fall in love
And whenever I compare you to someone
Shoot my heart out of joy

Everyone tells me what kind of woman you are
Predicts me my heart will be broken
But they just don't know you the way I know you
I know you through and through even if it is briefly

So don't think I'm listening
to the stories
I'm in the dark with you
But what does it matter

I fly I float, I feel that I am alive
When you lie in my arms in the morning

(I fly I float)

I dance, I laugh, and every day
my gaze is more focused on you

(I dance I smile)

I let my fingers dance along your sweet body
and dive into our game
Darling, I really think you are a world woman
You even give a polar bear goosebumps

So don't think I'm listening
to the stories
I'm in the dark with you
But what does it matter



I fly I float, I feel that I am alive
When you lie in my arms in the morning

(I fly I float)

I dance, I laugh, because every day
my gaze is more focused on you

(I dance I smile)

I breathe in and out
I live on the thoughts of you
I want you with hair and skin
you are a burning fire in the biting cold

I fly I float, I feel that I am alive
When you lie in my arms in the morning

(I'm flying I'm floating)

I dance, I laugh, and every day
my gaze is more focused on you

I just woke up
and suddenly I have the answer
To a conscientious question
Jump out of bed, call work
and quit my job
We're going to do it differently today

I break with the past and I go
chasing my heart

I was born to live
And not just go again
So I make sure I spend my time here well
No one in the world will
see me standing still
And everyone will know my name

it is no more
than twenty-four hours ago
and I'm lying on the beach laughing
Whether I get drunk
or look for work somewhere
I am in control

I break with the past and I go
Chasing my dream





I was born to live
And not just go again
So I make sure I spend my time here well
No one in the world will
see me standing still
And everyone will know my name

We're going to do it differently today
I break with the past and I go
chasing my heart

I was born to live
And not just go again
So I make sure I spend my time here well
No one in the world will
see me standing still
And everyone will know my name

I was born to live
And not just go again
So I make sure I spend my time here well
No one in the world will
see me standing still
And everyone will know my name <|endoftext|> 
Nobody knows why the day turns to night again
nobody knows why the sun shines.
Nobody knows why the chilly wind would blow
but i know i love you

Nobody knows why the stars are falling
no one knows why death follows us.
Nobody knows why people sleep in the cold
but i know i love you

Chorus
Hold me,
I kindly put my head on your shoulder
Hold me,
stroke me gently through my hair
Hold me,
sometimes it all becomes too much for a moment
and being with you is all I want.

Nobody knows why happiness sometimes blows away
and no one knows why a flower fades
Nobody knows why you're the only one I trust
but i know i love you



Chorus

Don't ask me anything
don't tell me anything.
Put your arms around me,
don't talk to me
hold me tight.

Words fall short anyway,
when I pour my heart out to you.
Don't talk to me
hold me tight.

Chorus <|endoftext|> 
Did I mention I have to go?

Fate asks me to travel far from here

So the future doesn't want to give any more time

give me one more kiss, give me one more kiss



There is no chance that I will win

of the dismay, so scolding makes no sense

So we can no longer enjoy it for long

give me one more kiss, give me one more kiss



Continue living when I disappear later

We will be together in mind



because i'm taking your love

and leave mine for you alone



How long do I have to live?

How long do I have to go?

How many times can I still lie with you

or just stand next to you?

How long can I give

what i have always done?

Crawl close to me for a while

2x



Crawl close to me for a while <|endoftext|> 
Nothing but the silence around us now
before the day begins
I have you alone for a while
I grab you and press you close
and I dance with you

Soon the sun will certainly take you with it
just a little while longer
then life divides us in two again
so i enjoy
while you're still here with me
and I dance with you

and I promise you from the bottom of my heart

when the music stops playing
I dance with you
to the beat of my heart
I dance with you forever



Even though the earth stops spinning
the sky loses its blue
i still dance with you

I have your tears in my eyes
your heart beats like mine
even the words I speak are yours

On the waves of love I dance with you
until the end of time
I dance with you forever

Even though the earth stops spinning
the sky loses its blue
i still dance with you
i still dance with you
even though the earth stops spinning

I dance with you forever <|endoftext|> 
In the early morning you spoke my name softly
And I knew you'd tell me it was time to go
You said honey don't worry. I will always be with you
And I knew you were telling the truth by how you looked at me
When you said, when you said

I am ready to travel.
To stand on the other side
Beyond the border I close my eyes
For everything to come, it's late
Am ready to travel, I've done everything
Take my hand and feel it flow
The love I carry with me, I ask you
Take me to the water
Take me to the lake
And put me down

It was just before noon
Your body released you
And the peace that came from your eyes took possession of me
I thought about what you said, what you said

I am ready to travel.
To stand on the other side
Beyond the border I close my eyes
For everything to come, it's late
Am ready to travel, I've done everything
Take my hand and feel it flow
The love I carry with me, I ask you
Take me to the water
Take me to the lake
And put me down
And put me down



I am ready to travel.
To stand on the other side
Beyond the border I close my eyes
For everything to come, it's late
I am ready to go travel
You did everything for me
So take my hand and feel it flow
The love that I convey, I ask you

Take me to the water
Take me to the lake
Take me to the water
For the very last time (2x)

Take me to the water
Take me to the lake

Plunder my heart
Steal me empty of my part
Bring what you find in my head
Reminders perhaps of that very beginning
Or a lie you like to believe
Twice alone
I feel the silence burning in my throat
Twice alone
Taste the salt on your skin
But you're walking out of my life

Cara Lucia come back
Cara lucia I can't live without you
Cara Lucia come back
Cara Lucia I can't live without you
Cara Lucia come back

Do what you have to
Hard bitter sweet
Take what you find in our bed with you
Love crumbs, maybe
Plate Yan plate Ying, or the feathers of your summer hat
Twice alone
I feel the silence burning in my throat
Twice alone
Still taste the salt on your skin, but you're walking out of my life

Open my eyes
Look around me
Everything seems to have changed
My stomach is acting funny and I feel strange

And I wonder what caused this feeling
My thoughts don't even seem like mine anymore
Can't find myself
And the reason that is you

You're in
inside my heart
inside my soul
From the inside
in since the day I fell for you
within
inside the dream I want to start with you
you are inside
within....

life was directed by me alone
but without saying anything (discussing with myself)
I reversed all roles
and I wonder why I'm doing what I'm doing now
but the answer to that question does not come from me
I seem to be going crazy
and the reason is you

You're in
inside my heart
inside my soul
From the inside
in since the day I fell for you
within
inside the dream I want to start with you
you are inside
within....

I'm on the back of your bike
we keep going faster
I can hardly see anything
I am faced with the choice
now off or with it forever
I decide to fight off the fears
and go with you forever
my head pressed against your back
and my arms around you ....



Within!
Inside my heart, inside my soul
from the inside
in since the day I fell for you
within
inside the dream I want to start with you
you are inside

heejiejeeeeeeeeeee hheeeeeeeeeeeeejjieeejeeeeeeeeee
heejiejieheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeejieheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
(etcetera)

inside my heart inside my soul
in since the day I fell for you
when I dream of you
when i think when i work when i am free
when I'm bored or lost myself again

inside my haaaaart
heejiejeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

you are inside

heejiejeeeeeeeeeeeeee

you are inside
you are inside
hejjieeeeeeeeeee hee! <|endoftext|> 
I cannot rest on a bed of gold
if the peace is not in me
i give everything i have for one thing
that hits me deeper than this

could just be back tomorrow
but if I have to, I travel all over the world
if only to see that what I was missing had been in front of me all along

I don't care if I'm lonely and alone
or find love that I found nowhere else
if it means ever finding myself again
at the place where I started
I want to burn myself in the sun
I want to burn myself in the sun

then let me burn in the sun
burn to the sun

help me back down
I see it all
the future, present and past
shout it in the same language
one fingers cut here and there
but everyone has

I see it around me (x2)



I close my eyes on a bed of wood
with a smile on my face

although I have to die to feel life
I let myself fall from heaven undisturbed
if it means ever finding myself again
at the place where I started

I want to burn myself to the sun (x2)
then let me burn in the sun

help me back down
I see it all
the future, present and past
shout it in the same language
one fingers cut here and there
but everyone has

I see it around me (x2) <|endoftext|> 
I wipe away my tears
a new beginning,
in my search for peace.
I cherish the hope
it's you
when I kiss her lips.

You take me home
are you taking me home tonight?
You take me home
are you taking me home tonight?

I see her standing here sometimes
always alone,
sometimes she looks at me too.
We never speak a word
but sometimes I think
maybe it will be her.



You take me home
are you taking me home tonight?
You take me home
are you taking me home tonight?

The beauty of fate,
to be alone,
you always feel free.
But my heart is hollow and cold
my life empty,
because what i miss is you.

You take me home
are you taking me home tonight?
You take me home
are you taking me home tonight?

You take me home
are you taking me home tonight?
You take me home
are you taking me home tonight? <|endoftext|> 
Did I mention I have to go
Fate asks me on a journey
Far from here
The future no longer wants to give time, so
Give me another kiss
Give me another kiss

There is no chance that I will win
Of the dismay
And swearing makes no sense
We can no longer enjoy, so
Give me another kiss
Give me another kiss

Go on living
When I disappear later
We will be together in mind
Because I'm taking your love with me
And leave mine behind
For you alone



How long do I have to live
How long do I have to go
How many times can I still lie with you
Or just stand next to you
How long can I still give
Which I've always done
Crawl close to me for a while

How long do I have to live
How long do I have to go
How many times can I still lie with you
Or just stand next to you
How long can I still give
Which I've always done
Crawl close to me for a while

Ooooooooooohooooooh
Ooooooooooohooooooh
Nananananaa
Ooooooooooohooooooh
Ooooooooooohooooooh
Ooooooooooohooooooh
Oooooooooooh
Crawl close to me for a while <|endoftext|> 
I hope you understand what I mean
And crying on a chair
I tell you I don't feel anything anymore
I kiss you but I don't think about you
There is another woman
It's not that I don't love you

Oh oh oooh it's over
The love between you and me
Oh oh oooh it's over
Numb when I'm free with you
Oh oh oooh it's over
You no longer belong to me
You no longer belong to me

Sobbing on your bed, tears full of evil
That I leave you
You say I want you to go now
I grab my coat, it's like I'm suffocating
And with a soft sobbing
I'll give you one last look



Oh oh oooh it's over
The love between you and me
Oh oh oooh it's over
Numb when I'm free with you
Oh oh oooh it's over
You no longer belong to me
You no longer belong to me

You never cheated on me
I always looked straight into your eyes
Could always say what I wanted
Never looked at other women
We said we were getting married
So it is certainly not your fault

Oh oh oooh it's over
The love between you and me
Oh oh oooh it's over
Numb when I'm free with you
Oh oh oooh it's over
You no longer belong to me
You don't belong with me <|endoftext|> 
I lay down
And think
It was so long ago
That you
To me
You paid full attention
I so long for your arms around me
And I long for a moment with you alone
preferably immediately (2x)

Love me
Please
Love me
Please
Fight
For us
Continuous

Do you know
Even then
We did everything together
How we meet
Unconditionally adored

I desire
To live with you
Closer to me
And I long
So to your body by my side
Forever (2x)



Love me
Please
Love me
Please
Fight
For us
Continuous

I long for you
Your arms around me
I long for a moment
With you alone
Right away
Preferably immediately

Love me
Please
Love me
Please
Fight
For us
Continuous

Love me (2x) <|endoftext|> 
Look outside it's morning
This is a day you will remember
Get up quickly and go
There are those who believe in you
Do not give up

Once in every life
There comes a time
We walk out all alone
And into the light
The moment won't last but then,
We remember it again
When we close our eyes.

Like stars across the sky
And to captivate
You will have to win
We were born to shine
All of us here because we believe



Look ahead and never turn around
Caress with your dreams
Your hopes and then
Towards the day to come
There is a milestone there

Like stars across the sky
And to captivate
You will have to win
We were born to shine
All of us here because we believe

Do not give up
Someone is with you

Like stars across the sky
We were born to shine
And to captivate
You will have to win
And then you will win <|endoftext|> 
I count the hours between tomorrow and today
And always be disappointed,
It takes longer and longer for the moon to leave the sky,
While I wait
At your decision.

Try to guess how you think and what you feel
And what you think of my sorrow
I hope you don't do it out of pity
Because such a relationship
I do not want,



Just don't think about me
Really do it just for you
Cause with you
Doesn't make sense
If you don't really love me.

Feel free to take a while,
Otherwise you'll regret it later
Or have I already lost you? <|endoftext|> 
One blow and I was awake.
A handwritten note that told me.
That she had finally found the love she had been looking for so much and that she couldn't find in me.

You poor bastard. You are really upset.
A doctor's prescription and so I was obliged to travel.
Three times, I was on the beach a day later.
Recovering from my hangover, with a cocktail, I carelessly looked at two feet in the sand.

Are you going to dive later? I hear a name and get a hand.
She smelled so good, so that didn't seem like a good plan.
I'd rather stay on dry land if I can choose, is that okay too?

Chorus.
I said; I am afraid of water, it is much too deep for me
All the fish bite and I don't see the bottom.
And from the bottom up, I panic.
Maybe later, but rather not for a while.

Day two, finished book. I stare at the setting sun.
The most beautiful woman I have seen in my life steps right out of the surf onto the steps of my balcony.
I recognize her smell. She says come with you and turns around.
Am afraid of water, and that's how it started.
I almost drowned once, she says. I get it, but I'll help you through it.



Chorus.
I said; I am afraid of water, it is much too deep for me
All the fish bite and I don't see the bottom.
And from the bottom up, I panic.
I am afraid of water, but I was just not with her.

Fifteen years later. Unbelievable how fast time goes.
I see my son standing on the edge of the deep, watching. To a girl who is a bit further away.
She jumps into the water and he stands still.
She comes upstairs and he gives me a frightened look.
When I met your mother I was just as scared.
And now you are here.

I am afraid of water.
I am afraid of water, it is much too deep for me
All the fish bite and I don't see the bottom.
And from the bottom up, I panic.
I am afraid of water but I was just not with her.

whoowoo whoowoo whoowoo whoowoo

I am afraid of water. It's way too deep for me
I am afraid of water, but it was with her for a while.
I am afraid of water, but it was with her for a while.
Ooohh I'm afraid of water but with her I was it for a while

Not. <|endoftext|> 
I've been thinking a lot lately
about what you mean exactly
if you ask me if I am what you are waiting for
and what you feel so much for

but even though my heart keeps asking me
don't feel enough
my head answers me over and over
it is still much too early



but it's over now
don't say I don't miss you
for fear fills the void
suppose I'm mistaken
and that it is not

but I have to let you go
time will not stand still
and I can only give myself
to love for a woman
and to you
if my head trusts my heart <|endoftext|> 
When running no longer makes sense
Then I'll be next to you
You are never alone
When it's too late for flights
And the gods attack
When the hour of battle has come
And if everything is taken from you
Then I'll come and fight with you

I'll be quiet
Silent and invisible
Like the sun in the clouds
Which reappears every moment

I'll be quiet
But if you need me
If you need me
I will always be there

When your world falls over
Then we pick her up
And then I'll help you build just as long
Until you are ready and confident
Until then, I'm really not going anywhere



I'll be quiet
Silent and invisible
When the wind dies
Until you spread your wings again

I'll be quiet
But if you need me
If you need me
I will always go for it
You are

When you row and you look and you look
When no way out appears anywhere
When the waves are so high
That the land in the distance
In the swirling water disappears
And the light of the sun and the moon
Threatening to perish forever
Don't feel any ground under your feet anymore
Then take my hand
And I'll make sure you stand firm

When running no longer makes sense
I will be next to you
Stand <|endoftext|> 
The first ray of sunshine lands on your face
Still can't believe you're lying here next to me now
That feeling I had with you so beautiful last night does not want to lose it
I wish I could make sure you'll always stay with me
Because with love comes the fear of loss
The more I love you, the greater the pain and sorrow will soon become
Because everything that rises has to go down one day
It is a given
Everything comes and everything goes sooner or later

I have the wind in my back and your arms around me
I surrender completely and all this time has been borrowed
I have decided that I want to enjoy every second so I let go of all my worries
And I don't think about tomorrow because today you are with me
As my father said

Don't worry about the fear that everything will go back soon
Otherwise you will miss every open door and everything beautiful that is in front of you
Believe me it is a waste of time and soon it will be too late

Remember that everything that rises has to go down sometime
It is a given
Everything comes and everything goes
But even though every moment you experience now will soon be a thing of the past
You want to experience it
So don't be anywhere but the moment



Don't worry about the fear that everything will go back soon
Believe me it's a waste of time
And soon it will be too late

Remember that everything that rises has to go down sometime
It is a given
Everything comes and everything goes
But even though every moment you experience now will soon be a thing of the past
You want to experience it
So don't be anywhere but the moment

Aim your arrows high and shoot if you miss
And enjoy it as long as something is there
Better to regret the things you did than what you will not know later
Promise me you won't forget that

Everything that rises will come down one day
And you only have one life
So don't be anywhere but the moment

The first ray of sunshine lands on your face
Still can't believe you're lying here next to me now <|endoftext|> 
When all the lights have gone out.
Am I alone with my thoughts.
And I know with the applause still in my head
this time will ever come to an end.

When the encore is over.
The seats are empty, the room is dark.
Oh, I know this moment will come one day.
But when it comes, you will be there.

If the curtain closed forever.
The final chord played.
I hide with you.
You come out of the shadows into the light.
With that smile on your face.
And you catch me before I fall.
And you take me with you.



When all the stories have been told.
The last song has sounded.
And the ice beneath my feet is slowly melting.
I feel you very close to me.

If the curtain closed forever.
The final chord played.
I hide with you.
You come out of the shadows into the light.
With that smile on your face.
And you catch me before I fall.
And you take me with you.

With a deep bow, I say goodbye.
Thank my audience one more time.
My greatest love, I thank last.
I wouldn't be here without you.

If the curtain closed forever.
The final chord played.
I hide with you.
You come out of the shadows into the light.
With that smile on your face.
And you catch me before I fall.
And you take me with you. <|endoftext|> 
The whole world is crazy
We live here with billions
Yellow, white and black
Muslims and Jews
We slap each other
Shoot countries to pieces
And there are deaths every day

Hey dude we should be ashamed
The world is ours together

I'm living my life today
And if possible, much longer
Without violence, hatred and misery
But that is still the question
The whole world is getting more scared
Who makes that mess
That gigantic mess

Hey dude we should be ashamed
The world is ours together



Chorus

When the world is ours
Then there are no limits
I dream of that
A borderless existence
When the world is ours
Then it's about people
That's what it's about
That should be the point

When the world is ours
Then there are no limits
I dream of that
A borderless existence
when the world is ours
it's about people
that's what it's about
that must be the point oho yeahe ohoh

chorus 4x <|endoftext|> 
often away
days away from home
no longer enjoy
of peace in the house
It's hard work
and even though it is nice
there are those moments
that I would love to be with you

and then you are there
i see your face
inside my eyes
a heavenly light shines
and you are so close
and so life-size
you look at me
and laughs your teeth
and I know

even though my world is so gray
I always find my comfort with you
the harshest truth is softened
if only you smile at me
if only you smile at me

hotel
the other in
a job just about
and the next one starts again
I have to go
although sometimes it doesn't work
especially at those moments
that I don't see everything anymore

then you are there
and I see your face
inside my eyes
a heavenly light shines
and you are so close
and so life-size
baby you look at me
and smile your teeth blood
and I know



even though my world is so gray
I always find my comfort with you
the harshest truth is softened
if only you smile at me
if only you smile at me

can they stop me where the sun doesn't shine
as long as your smile never disappears

(after after after after after after after after after after after)

even though my world is so gray
I always find my comfort with you
the harshest truth is softened
if only you smile at me

even though my world is so gray
I always find my comfort with you
the harshest truth is softened
if only you smile at me
if only you smile at me <|endoftext|> 
How fragile she was, was she fragile when you met her
Like a rose petal so soft
She was a bit shaky and a bit angry at times but you could take it
That is what I thought

Time passed and it seemed she was getting better and better
Slowly she found strength again
Your love turned out to be the right color and then it happened
What I did not expect anymore
You helped her build from the ground up until she could do everything herself
Until she stood
Until she found her legs and her wings

Well I hope she enjoys all the beauty she's seeing now
And that the wind will carry its wings forever
Because you grant her her happiness in spite of your tears of sorrow
But I hope she arm herself for the fall

Because you know love
She seems much stronger now than you but appearances are deceiving
She doesn't see it
Because when you fall it is sometimes just like flying
It feels like you are flying

How caring and charming he was when you met him
What a cure for the pain
You still held off, heartbroken, but he couldn't be stopped
Too good to be true
From the start, he has a sea of ​​flowers at your pedestal
But when he had you
Just as suddenly as he came, he went




Well I hope he enjoys all the beauty he sees there
And that he will find his happiness there
Because you don't want to weigh him down with your tears of sorrow
But I hope he arms himself for the fall

Because you know love
He seems much higher now than you but appearances are deceiving
He doesn't see it
Because when you fall it is sometimes just like flying
It feels like you are flying

So don't think now my love
That you are the weakest
It's not that hard to deal with
Because when the storm comes
And everyone is going to run
The strongest trees remain
And the head in the clouds does not say yet
That someone can fly
Always the shortest route
Makes you faster
But it does make you wiser

I'm so proud of you
When I see how strong you are
And it keeps you getting stronger <|endoftext|> 
I've been thinking a lot lately
About what you mean exactly
If you ask me if I am what you are waiting for
And what you feel so much for
But even though my heart keeps asking me
Don't you feel enough?
My head answers me over and over
It is still too early

But it's over now
Doesn't say I don't miss you
Because fear fills the void
Suppose I'm mistaken
And that it is not
But I have to let you go
Because time will not stand still
And I can only give in to the
Love for a woman
And to you
When my head trusts my heart <|endoftext|> 
I wipe the tears from my face
you still have your eyes closed
I could watch for hours
how you lie in front of me now

you always lived every day
but lately when I saw you
you didn't feel like laughing anymore
I wondered why

for that is life
happiness and sadness
it was given to you
but you didn't want to
are you happy now
or are you sorry now
do you miss the years we were together
because that was a good time

I wonder where or where you are now
and if I knew you
because something in you that I couldn't reach
was never used to this life
you could count on me a little more
and I had been closer to you
I could have told you something then
why you might not have done this?



because this was your life
happiness and sadness
it was given to you
but you didn't want to
are you happy
or are you sorry now
do you miss the years we were together
because that was a good time

if you could choose where to go
would you come back here, or far from here?

because this was your life
happiness and sadness
it was given to you
but you didn't want to
are you happy
or are you sorry now
do you miss the years we were together
because that was a good time

this was your life
here you were at home
where have you been
so far from home
are you sad
or are you liberated
and were the years we were together
nothing more than a waste of time?

anyway you lost everything <|endoftext|> 
The moon appears
and you come to visit
in my memory

You shut up and laugh
softens the pain for a while
until I wake up again
with nothing, alone



Time regrets
that he was mistaken
and even the wind howls with pain
missed you

The moon disappears
leave me empty-handed
the night she takes you
and leave me alone <|endoftext|> 
I see the first flakes of snow
Through the window frame
I feel your arms around me
And whisper your name softly
I'm right back where it once started
Together outside on the ice
Frozen in the cold
I only felt the heat
In my heart for you
And for a moment I experience again
What I would feel all my life

And after all this time
Are you here
Nothing seems to have changed
Even if ever
I my heart
Entrust to someone else
I celebrate Christmas with you

Running through the snow together
The setting sun
There is always a song
That I recognize from us
Get in quickly
Where it is warm and cozy
The white landscape around us
And the sky so blue
Christmas has so many faces
They are reminiscent of you
Would give anything
If you just get back in my life
Would come

Because after all this time
Are you here
And nothing has changed
Even if ever
I my heart
Entrust to someone else



You stay the end
And the beginning
It around me
The center
You stay forever
By my side

In every word
And every sentence
Is there something that connects you with me
You will stay my life
With me

I see the first flakes of snow
Through the window frame

And after all this time
Are you here
Nothing has changed
Even if ever
I my heart
Entrust to someone else
I celebrate Christmas with you <|endoftext|> 
Wouldn't you like to be endlessly rich?
For one day
Awaken as a king and bathe in luxury
Everything you saw was gold
For one day on the throne of a castle in the air

But without your cloak
No one would see who you are anymore
An ordinary appearance that is fragile
No longer recognized as a king
Uninhibited and naked
A person comes into the world
And naked we leave here again

Because everything stays behind
Heal your property
Your hands are empty
At the end of the ride
Nobody is powerful
And everyone small
At the end of the line

Wouldn't you like to be more beautiful than beautiful?
if it were possible
Successful in life
Famous and adored
As radiant and warm as the sun
Inept and naked
A person comes into the world
And naked we leave here again



Because
Everything is left behind
Heal your property
Your hands are empty
At the end of the ride
Nobody is powerful
And everyone small
At the end of the line

Everyone dances
Everyone laughs
Everybody knows
That the end awaits
Any truth
Is a lie
Because nobody in this paradise
Is ready at the end of the trip

Everything is left behind
Heal your property
Your hands are empty
At the end of the ride
Nobody is powerful

And everyone small
At the end of the line

At the end of .. <|endoftext|> 
There is no such thing as saying goodbye
I will leave but I will not leave you
My love, you have to believe me, even if it hurts.

I want you to let go of me
and that you will continue tomorrow
But if you are lonely or scared
will I be there

Come like the wind you feel and the rain
Follow what you do like the light of the moon
look for me in everything then you will meet me
Whisper my name ... and I'll be right there

See ... what is invisible
What you believe is true
Open your eyes and
then I'll be with you
Everything you have to do
is taking my word for it



There is no such thing as saying goodbye

I come like the wind you feel and the rain!
Follow what you do like the light of the moon!
look for me in everything then you will meet me!
Whisper my name ... and I'll be right there!

Look in the sky, look at the sea!
Wherever you will walk, yes I will walk with you!
Every step and every moment ...
wherever you are!

Whatever you do, wherever you go ...
when you need me ...
just whisper my name ...
and I'm coming !!!

There is no such thing as saying goodbye ...! <|endoftext|> 
It's not that I don't trust you or am suspicious of you.
I can give myself everything if I know you better
Even though I think you are great, everything in its time
A little more and more, I expose myself
But now when I'm insecure, I keep myself big
It's just me, the vulnerability
Cheated so often, sit crying like a child

But I look into your eyes and love wins
Here I go again, I put myself in it
There I go again, there is no point in hiding
Because love, I know she finds me

I'm just careful because your love scares me
But I also cannot deny that I often long for you
I just can't just let myself go
Lied so often that I don't commit so quickly



But I look into your eyes and love wins
Here I go again, I put myself in it
There I go again, there is no point in hiding
Because love, I know she finds me

When morning comes and she goes looking, I know she'll find me
I get down on my knees when she's in front of me
It's too late. It's too late

Here I go again, I put myself in it
There I go again, there is no point in hiding
Here I go again, I put myself in it
There I go again, there is no point in hiding
Because love, I know she finds me <|endoftext|> 
Now stay here, please don't go baby
Now stay here, I don't want to be alone
Now stay here, please don't go baby
Now stay here, I don't want to be alone anymore

Just a day
Just a smile
A smile on your face



When you are there
You make me happy
It gives me balance

Don't go away and stay a while longer
Do not leave me alone
I can't live without your smile

Now stay here, please don't go baby
Now stay here, I don't want to be alone
Now stay here, please don't go baby
Now stay here, I don't want to be alone anymore <|endoftext|> 
18 years I saw you walking
Wavy hair deep blue eyes
You looked to be unbelievable
For a moment I was broken

18 years a summer evening
Hold me until the sun comes up
I gotta go give me another kiss
Come on let's be stupid

And who would have thought
The two of us for so many years
Still happy with each other
Yes you made all my dreams come true

And when you smile at me
I still feel after all this time
What I do with you and you with me
I never want to never lose you again
Who would have thought

18 years we keep it open
So in love but the fire can still go out
Day to day never promises anything
And nothing expects how crazy things can go



Who would have thought
The two of us for so many years
Still happy with each other
Yes you made all my dreams come true

And when you smile at me
I still feel after all this time
What I do with you and you with me
I never want to never lose you again
Who would have thought

It has been said so many times this is not real
No you are much too young
But we always persisted
And now we are here

So give me your hand
Look deep into my eyes
Because the way we stand here together
I promise to go on forever

Who would have thought
That we still do after so many years
Declare love to each other
You still make my dreams come true

And when you smile at me
I still feel after all this time
That I belong to you and you belong to me
I never want to never lose you again
Who would have ever expected that <|endoftext|> 
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I now know why I exist
I only have one goal and that's you

Whatever I see, wherever I am
I hear your voice in every sound
Just like that you bring my desire close

And now you're in my arms
I have never known so much love
And I don't dare to sleep anymore
I'm afraid you won't be here tomorrow

Deeper and deeper into the night
and I still can't get to sleep
I've been waiting for this for years
and I can't take the tension anymore
oh oh, don't you ever wanna go



Whatever I take, whatever I give
and every day that I am still alive
I stay with you and make you happy

And even though I want you forever
it makes myself so vulnerable and so small
And I don't dare to sleep anymore
I'm afraid you won't be there tomorrow

Deeper and deeper into the night
and I still can't get to sleep
I've been waiting for this for years
and I can't take the tension anymore

And now you're right here with me
I have never known so much love
And I don't dare to sleep anymore
I'm afraid you won't be here tomorrow

Deeper and deeper into the night
and I still can't get to sleep
Deeper and deeper into the night
I've been waiting for this for years
Deeper and deeper into the night
and I can't take the tension anymore
oh oh, don't you ever wanna go
Deeper and deeper …… .. <|endoftext|> 
If the sun stopped shining
And when the light was turned off
If the moonlight disappeared
Would I be in the dark

But I would certainly find you
Find with my eyes closed
Because your smile would blind me
When you smile it becomes light

I want you forever
I really don't ever want to lose you
Don't go, stay here, stay with me
No I don't want you to go
Maybe tomorrow will be too late
So stay with me
Stay with me

If the Earth didn't turn
In the endless blue
Not a day had been lost
Because my world revolves around you



I want you forever
I really don't ever want to lose you
Don't go, stay here, stay with me
No I don't want you to go
Maybe tomorrow will be too late
So stay with me
Stay with me

Stay with me because I'm cold
Stay with me if you love me then
Then nothing goes wrong anymore
I know you belong with me
And when you're with me
I have the world at my feet

If I didn't hear you again
And the love was over
I was hopelessly lost
So why don't you stay with me

I want you forever
I really don't ever want to lose you
Don't go, stay here, stay with me
No I don't want you to go
Maybe tomorrow will be too late
So stay with me
Stay with me <|endoftext|> 
If people talk badly about me, I don't care.
I don't care anymore if they talk bad about me.
Because I only put energy into something I love, like you.

If there is a fight again about something small, it makes me laugh.
I don't worry if I get caught up or have to wait.
Because I just close my eyes and think of the most beautiful woman, like you.

Like you, you give me confidence.
As with you, with you I let myself go.
If I had just 21 lives I would have shared them all with you.
Then I wouldn't have wanted anything but you 21 times.



If I feel like they are lying to me, they can forget.
I leave all people who do not want to know the truth.
Because I only make an effort for what I trust, such as for you.

As for you, you give me confidence.
As for you, with you I let myself go.
If I had just 21 lives I would have shared them all with you.
Then I wouldn't have wanted anything but you 21 times.

You give me confidence!
Nothing like you makes me feel so free.
If I had just 21 lives I would have shared them all with you.
Then I wouldn't have wanted anything but you 21 times.
Wanted you! <|endoftext|> 
Always together
My arms around you
My greatest love
I knew that immediately
The last few weeks, the days passed quickly
close comes the farewell,
it will be difficult

say you don't have to go baby
that you really had enough of me
say you don't have to go baby
go honey, because you have to
I know you have to

If possible, I would stay one more night with you
If possible, I would stay one more night with you
then I would say I'm waiting for you
and that the future smiles at us
then I would say for the umpteenth time,
I don't want anyone else ever again

The suitcases are already outside
the tailgate slams shut
one last long kiss
in the early morning light
You look at me sweetly
and grabs me tight
I whisper in your ear that I will not forget you



say you don't have to go baby
that you really had enough of me
say you don't have to go baby
go baby cause you have to
I know you have to

If possible, I would stay one more night with you
If possible, I would stay one more night with you
then I would say I'm waiting for you
and that the future smiles at us
then I would say for the umpteenth time,
I don't want anyone else ever again

Never again will I feel what I feel for you
i hope i can live without you
come on now, wipe away your tears, and remember very well
that I love you, love you

NO NO NO; you don't have to go baby, NO!
NO NO NO, you don't have to go baby, NO! <|endoftext|> 
Can't notice anything
From what I read in your eyes
Never know
That you were lonely

Don't see it coming
I was transfixed
When you said you couldn't find it with me anymore

It's a hard slap in my face
Which totally ruins me

Now stay standing (2x)
'Cause if you leave I'll die slowly
Now stay standing (2x)

Don't let me get lost

I've neglected you
That's why you run away from me
I lost you
That's what you say

Too selfish
I only thought about myself
I forgot you
That's what you told me



You leave me with all my doubts
The world is sinking from under me

Now stay standing (2x)

'Cause if you leave I'll die slowly
Now stay standing (2x)
Don't let me get lost

Now stay standing (2x)
'Cause if you leave I'll die slowly
Now stay standing (2x)
Don't let me get lost

Now stay standing (2x)
'Cause if you leave I'll die slowly
Now stay standing (2x)
Don't let me get lost

Get lost <|endoftext|> 
get all screwed up
all fall dead for my part
I don't feel like learning well
I'll end up in the gutter anyway

kids don't want to play with me
they call me rat and point after me
the only one who cares
there is never that one is dad

one mother do not tolerate me
I never do anything right for her
I don't have to ask for love either
swearing is all she does
no wonder my dad has gone sailing
I could not come along, I am too small
I have to do it on my own
until it would ever be back

Chorus
if only I had someone to love
two soft arms around me
who would always protect me
I feel so damned alone



maybe if father is a skipper
when it returns from the sea
says that still is: "listen Cis, why don't you come with me"
I'm just a kid after all
can't do it all alone
I may ever find happiness, but how that is a big problem

Chorus
if only I had someone to love
two soft arms around me,
who would always protect me
I feel so damned alone

who would always protect me
I feel so damned alone <|endoftext|> 
Danny;
I always used to think later.
I used to dream of water.
Be free, just like him.
With the wind in my hair,
sail on all seas.
Away from fears and pain.
Later when I grow up.
Ciske;
Do you know what you want to be later on?
Betje;
Housewife of course!
And then I want;
A garden full of buttercups and a cat that always purrs.
Three children to kiss and a hat with a ribbon.
At Christmas a tree full of balls and a ring of gold.
And sweet sweet darling who loves me very much.
Ciske;
Later I want to be that old man.
Later lugging around the world.
Be free, just like him.
With the wind in my hair,
sail on all seas.
Get away from that pissed off grumpy.
Later when I grow up.
Betje;
And you? You will definitely study.
Dorus;
I'm going to be a doctor.
And then I want;
A cupboard with beautiful books and a framed map.
So that I can look up where you sail in the world.
I want a filling cup that is very sweet and very loyal.
Really so sweet sweet darling that I love a lot.
Danny; I always used to think later. -> At the same time as ciske
Ciske; Later I want to be that old man.> At the same time as Danny
I used to dream of the water .-> at the same time as ciske
Carrying around the world-> at the same time as Danny
ciske & Danny;
Be free, just like him
Danny;
But how many of those beautiful dreams have actually come true?
I know, it's just appearances.
Danny & Ciske;
Later when I grow up.
Dorus;
I want a filling cup
Betje;
and a ring of gold.
All of them;
And a sweet sweet darling who loves me very much. <|endoftext|>

We have a young black tomcat at home that I often play with
When I'm doing my homework, he's sleeping on my book
I love that crazy animal very much

It's a mishmash
A mishmash
Of a tiger and a cat
With a wild cat on the flat at night
Then we got such a mix
It's a mishmash
A mishmash
Of a tiger and a cat
With a wild cat on the flat at night
Then we got such a mix



A very beautiful fifteen year old girl lives in our street
With a Dutch mother and a Moroccan father
That's why she got blue eyes and pitch black hair

She's a mix
A mishmash
Made of stew and koos-koes
With a shawl and jeans
She's a nice mix
She's a mix
A mishmash
Made of stew and koos-koes
With a shawl and jeans
She's a nice mix

I have a grand-niece who wants to be famous and also rich
She wants to sing she wants to get married play and carry a baby
She wants everything at once

She becomes a mishmash
A mishmash
From Doris Day and Cinderella
She looks like Tina Turner but is called Loes
That is only a mishmash
She becomes a mishmash
A mishmash
From Doris Day and Cinderella
She looks like Tina Turner but is called Loes
That is only a mishmash
She becomes a mishmash
A mishmash
From Doris Day and Cinderella
She looks like Tina Turner but is called Loes
That will only become a mishmash ... <|endoftext|> 
There are many beautiful women
in the life I see
but what have I done
she who is so dear to me
I hurt her a lot
and have really gone too far
she stands in front of me crying
put my arms around her
and I tell her I'll never leave you alone again

With my hand on my heart
I swear I love you
never want another woman
my sweet darling
blind to my eyes
yes no I swear
with my hand on my heart

they say every person deserves a second chance
but I know I will not get this as a gift
I have something to make up for
so no more messing around with anyone
because I want to cost you back what it costs
because you are my future after all
and I really don't want to lose that
baby I'm telling you what a regret I am



with my hand on my heart
I swear I love you
never want another woman
my sweet darling
blind to my eyes
yes no I swear
with my hand on my heart

with my hand on my heart
I swear I love you
never want another woman
my sweet darling
blind to my eyes
yes no I swear
with my hand on my heart

baby I swear <|endoftext|> 
You changed all my life
It all went so fast
You and I nothing stopped us
I often think back to that time


Your love has touched me deeply
So much released in me
That feeling can't be explained
Yes, you are and will remain for me
A lottery winning ticket,
I've wanted to tell you so many times.

I love you,
With all my heart and soul
So much of you
I squeeze my hands
With such a wife,
We grow old together.



I'm away from home a lot, days and nights,
And busy like everyone else
But with you on my mind
I never feel, damn alone.

You can always rely on me
No one can stand in your shadow
That feeling can't be explained
Yes, you are and will remain for me
A lottery winning ticket,
I've wanted to tell you so many times.

Chorus 2x

[End game] <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes those very small everyday things,
you can't get around to or simply can't.
Then a little help is crazy, it makes you happy inside,
to know that there is someone who will always support you.
"Thank you", that sounds a bit bare.
A bunch of flowers says it all.

here's a flower for you
because you are always there for me
and you never want anything in return.
How much I love you, yes this little flower says that
that's why this flower is for you.

Have you got something to make up for, haven't seen a friend for a long time
send a flower, that is very special.
Is it someone's birthday, is it better or successful?
A small bouquet often says more than a long story.
Flowers give things all their color,
they always put you in a good mood.
that's why this flower is for you.

Here's a flower for you
because you are always there for me
and you never want anything in return.
How much I love you,
yes, that's what this flower says, that's why this flower is for you.

Tulips, Roses, Carnations, they bring so much beauty
For someone you've missed very much
then you say "dear whopper, yes these are for you
my number 1 if you didn't know that already ".



Here's a flower for you
because you are always there for me
and you never want anything in return.
How much I love you,
yes, that's what this flower says, that's why this flower is for you.

Lalalalala .....

Yes, that's what this flower says, that's why this flower is for you.

I'm looking for nice words
to charm your heart
with you every night
I dream of blue seas
of the most beautiful orchids
and love with you
I am writing a beautiful poem
and then hope you will give in to me
if I said something

But then I spoil everything with that hackneyed sentence
I love you

And then I see in your gaze
you think with fright
I've heard that phrase so many times now
I wonder then
why do I find at such a moment
never the right word
that's how it goes every time
yes every time
when i try to say what i mean
I wish I could explain it out
and you could finally say
what I feel for you
The evening is perfect
and in my arms lies my dream
all I wanted

But then I spoil everything with that hackneyed sentence
I love you

(musical interlude)



The evening is perfect

Get all fucked up anyway
All of you fall dead for my part
I don't feel like learning well
I'll end up in the gutter anyway

Children don't want to play with me
Call me "Rat," and point after me
The only one who cares
There never is, that's my dad

My mother cannot bear me
I never do anything right for her
I don't have to ask for love either
Swearing is all she does

No wonder my dad went sailing
I was not allowed, I am too small
I have to do it on my own
Until he will be back someday



CHORUS:
If only I had someone to love
Two soft arms around me
Who would always protect me
I feel so damned alone

maybe when father's ship arrives
when he's back from the sea
he says again listen sis why don't you come with me

I'm just a kid after all
Can't do it all alone
Maybe someday I will find happiness
But how, that's a big problem

CHORUS
If only I had someone to love
Two soft arms around me
Who would always protect me
I feel so damned alone

you look in the mirror
no you are not 18 anymore
but life still has enough to give you
you've come a long way
but you are far from done
fortunately there is something to hold on to in your life
your children your own flesh and blood
you go through fire for them if you have to
they are living proof of your love
the reason you are always busy
their eyes are the mirrors of your life
in which you recognize yourself all too often
sometimes when you look at them you feel tears
of pure happiness and you get confused
of that you left existence something
your children are living proof

Danny de Munk - This is my life

Always with the vice on my face
As a child I was always on the street

Liked to play until the evening light
And came home, time and again too late

Yes, the neighborhood was really my life
Sometimes I paid the price

But it is wise to become through harm and shame

Chorus:
This is my life,
My happiness and sadness,
This is my life,
You don't change me
No more and no less no matter how I'm doing
I'll always be that boy from the street.

Today I am fully in life
Enjoy everything in its time

The vice has remained the rebellious
no, I will never lose that in my life

I have found my own way
I'll see what the future will bring

And always stay as everyone knows me

Chorus:
This is my life,
My happiness and sadness,
yes this is my life
You don't change me
No more and no less no matter how I'm doing
I'll always be that boy from the street.



I often had to fight hard
did not just get it as a present

My life is full of joy and sorrow
I always follow the way of my heart

Chorus:
This is my life,
My happiness and sadness,
yes this is my life
You don't change me
No more and no less no matter how I'm doing
I'll always be that boy from the street.

I always stay
that boy
of the stra-a-at. <|endoftext|> 
There is an occasional twist under my roof
Sometimes I don't feel well under my roof
Under my roof I occasionally hear a rumble
Sometimes it doesn't work quickly under my roof

Fuck my boss
I also work here for my money
I had to learn for years
I know what to do
Can a person still make a mistake?
I'm just saying what it says like
Then he says: hey dude we can miss you
You can go, you're on the street

There is an occasional twist under my roof
Sometimes I don't feel well under my roof
Under my roof I occasionally hear a rumble
Sometimes it doesn't work quickly under my roof



When I come home everything is deserted
Because my wife went to her boss
And I slowly notice
I'm a fool, a fool, a fool
Then quickly make some coffee
And take the little one out of the nursery
Will someone else watch me
I believe I get stressed

There is an occasional twist under my roof
Sometimes I don't feel well under my roof
Under my roof I occasionally hear a rumble
Sometimes it doesn't work quickly under my roof

I want to make new friends now
In that bare coffee house
And let the rest all that matters
With my wife, my child at home
I am also misted again
Then I beat things up again
Why do I feel so gagged
Or isn't seeing a houseman strange? <|endoftext|> 
I still feel the hard calluses
Your hand caressing my child's sphere
With you on the street the first steps
You taught me to kick a ball
And others scolded me badly
Could I threaten my big dad

refr .:
    Because daddy I miss you every day
    Daddy I miss your singing and laughing
    Daddy give me one more advice
    I did not forget you
    I have to live on myself
    I hope things get better tomorrow

I grew up to be a good boy
You were proud of me like a monkey
But when I made love to my girl
There was a rift between us
It reminded you of the old days
But you didn't want to say anything about that



refr.

Now earn my own salary
I still hope for a son
Which I for eternity of days
Will always carry on hands
I hope when he stands on his own two feet
His father will still ask for advice

refr. (2x) <|endoftext|> 
You wake up in the mornin '
You wake up one morning
Have you here work lame
And you haven't had a job for years
And your mother do the table
And your old mom sets the table
You see the same old same
And you see all those old things on the table again come Heinz corn flakes
Lay your foot by the table
You put both your feet on the table
And you have awe a bit of pain
You stretch your back
Have you ever seen a rainbow
Have you ever seen a rainbow
Yes I don't know what this does in the text, I didn't write it
You get in trouble with a man
And you get me arguing with a man there
Who you think is your father
But it turns out to be the electric milkman of that morning

And what do you sing then

Let the midnight special shine a light on me
Oh let the midnight special shine a light on me yeah yeah

refr .:
    Oh midnight shine a light on me
    Oh midnight shine a light on me oh yeah
    Oh midnight shine a light on me
    Oh midnight shine a light on me



And they rot you out of the house
Looks around the world
It's early April
The flowers emerge from the ground
You have pain in your Auror
From the packs of beer you're carrying
You have a girl going on
That asks for presents from you

refr.

In the harbor in the sun
You think for hours
You dream about a bank robbery
And the police are after you
Before you have been able to buy gifts
He'll catch you
You sit in the cell humming
He was too fast and I was too slow

refr.

Tonight <|endoftext|> 
If you can't wait, it will take a long time
Before you know if she's coming or not
And if she comes and you can't cry
You don't know what to do with your grief
Because you already know what she will say
She says that every time
I'm late, I know baby
But this is really the last time

How long has it been now
That you started with that for the first time
I should have ended it right away
But even I was too stupid for that
Now I see how you twirl with words
Because I am silent and that makes me anxious
I hear your apology
And I hear how much you love me



refr .:
    I watch the sun disappear over your shoulders
    I remember I haven't eaten yet
    If I want I can still get line 10, but I don't want to
    Because I haven't told you everything yet
    I watch the sun disappear over your shoulders
    I remember I haven't eaten yet
    If I want I can still get line 10, but I don't want to

If I can't wait it will take a long time
Before I know if you're coming or not
I don't care why you come so late
I won't be there next time
Because I already know what you will say
You say that every time
I'm late, I know baby
But this is really the last time

refr. <|endoftext|> 
I only had 1 illusion, I wanted to review it
That's why my mother always got upset
Because she was so reformed as I said Snip and Snap
She started to slap with the Bible
Then I packed my bags and wrote to her in a letter:
Your Bible lessons have not failed
Because I'm going to leave you to see for myself
Where Abraham got the mustard

refr .:
    Mother, I want to be in the review
    Even if you are all turned upside down
    Mother, I want to be in the review
    I want to make people fall from their seats with laughter
    Guys, what am I to envy
    When I come down those high stairs with twenty naked girls
    Always caviar, no more potatoes with gravy
    Mother, I want to be in the review

I didn't find mustard after that, but I did find a nice girl
I lived with that in sin
She was a revue danseuse and I sang in the choir
I seemed to have found my calling
But one evening at the exit of Carré
Mother was ready with the Statenbijbel
With which she hit me in the hospital in one fell swoop
Yet I still sang from the stretcher back then



refr.

Then I wrote a song on my sick bed and it's called
Ah mother with your blessing hands
Then she forgiven me and for good reason
The song became a hit in all countries
Now tired also walks in the maxi, she has bleached
She got an interview with willem duijs
And I have my own super show with my wife
There I sing in front of a packed house

refr. <|endoftext|> 
Michiel take a seat
Just leave your bag for a while
You can after dinner anyway
Still go outside for a while

I have to tell you something
It may be a bit harsh
But your mother and me
Have decided to part ways

It certainly made no sense anymore
You've heard the arguments
Once that has to go through
All three of us are disturbed
At least your mom and dad

refr .:
    Because it's not up to you
    You can not help it
    You're a nice kid
    And you keep your decency
    And I will miss you
    I will miss you

We see each other regularly
I think every week
Then we will do fun things
I really won't let you down



And if your mother has something to whine about
Then you come to me
I am from January
Full days off

Michiel you don't have to cry
Actually nothing changes
I will soon live in the center
That is 10 minutes on the bike

That is not that far, Michiel

refr.

Well my son the best
Just keep working for your school
Oh your mother once in a while
And keep practicing on your violin

refr. <|endoftext|> 
There are girls who do it reluctantly
there are girls who like it
Marianneke does it with great pleasure
oh how happy I will be with that (oh yeah) 2x

Marianneke it is a sweet girl,
but she can't cook.
She prepares radishes for me and calls them beetroot.
And in the afternoon the fire brigade drives out screaming through the city.
It is a medium fire
My sweetheart bakes chips.

Because there are girls who do it reluctantly
there are girls who like it
Marianneke does it with great pleasure
oh how happy I will be with that (oh yeah) 2x

Marianneke it is a sweet girl,
but she cannot knit.
My socks are so uneven you don't know what you see.
She quickly calls a handkerchief with a hole in it a blouse.
Marianneke is a sweet girl,
she's just a sweetheart.

Because there are girls who do it reluctantly
there are girls who like it
Marianneke does it with great pleasure
oh how happy I will be with that (oh yeah) 2x



But sometimes she's pretty stupid
everything goes wrong.
But she taught me that I can have such good time off (weeeeee).

Because there are girls who do it reluctantly
there are girls who like it
Marianneke does it with great pleasure
oh how happy I will be with that (oh yeah) 2x

Because there are guys who do it reluctantly
there are guys who like it
but Willem does it with great pleasure
oh how happy I will be

Because there are girls who do it reluctantly
there are girls who like it
Marianneke does it with great pleasure
oh how happy I will be with that (oh yeah) 3x <|endoftext|> 
We'll close the curtains tonight and I'll kiss all your tears from your face
We'll keep talking until morning light, you're not alone anymore
I just had to get away from you for a while
Now I have my thoughts lined up again
Even though it feels a bit awkward, I will drag you through it

Just like nothing happened, we go to sleep you can
Waking up in my arms after a long night my darling
And I promise I will cook you a treat tomorrow
One thing I know for sure dear, if you can do it I can too

I know very well I abandoned you
Understand that is why you are upset now
But while I know it seemed different, I didn't leave you alone
I also had no control over my feelings
I too looked like a mountain against the night
Where I couldn't sleep when I thought he must feel alone



But now I've decided I'll come back to you
It was bad for a while, but that is now over

As if nothing happened, we go to sleep you can
Waking up in my arms after a long night my darling
And I promise I will cook you a treat tomorrow
One thing I know for sure dear, if you can do it I can too

As if nothing happened, we go to sleep you can
Waking up in my arms after a long night my darling
And I promise I will cook you a treat tomorrow
One thing I know for sure dear, if you can do it I can too <|endoftext|>

I thought I am happy
But I turned around
Without thinking
I left you alone (how stupid)
I stand in front of the mirror
And I see myself standing
Then I say to myself
It's time to go back

Chorus:
Oooh, I've been stupid again
What am I doing to myself again
Oh, I've been stupid again
What am I doing to myself

No matter how I'm talking
Whatever I tell you
You don't want to believe me
You don't even listen (who does)
Still, I will continue with you
Step by step through life
They will call me crazy
That I disturb you



Chorus

When I look at myself
Get old and gray
It won't happen to me
I don't seem very wise
Hard confrontations
I can no longer ignore it
I would like to be different
But I can't live alone

Chorus

I've been stupid again
What am I doing to myself
Oh, I've been stupid again
What am I doing to myself <|endoftext|> 
When I answered the phone
I already knew: that's you
A premonition of anyway,
after all that being alone
being alone for too long, you come.
You said we need to talk
or maybe not talk
but it can no longer be so ".
I'll be there soon
but you didn't say when

If it doesn't get lucky
what you expect from it
because life is more difficult
than I imagined
did I say:
"don't come here anymore".
Oh those things that I said
or anything I didn't say
but why am I crying
when I think: Wednesday, Tuesday
or maybe .... tomorrow?

Still, I want to be ahead of the time
When you come I'll be home
And my heart will be your home again
come here with me
Gone are all those quiet hours
the same walls every night
a vague friend and one, two neighbors
come here with me ...



Is there still who was wrong
I say you
Will there remain who left home here,
I say you
Was it just me?
Was it just me?


And yet I want to be ahead of the time
When you come I'll be home
And my heart will be your home again
come here with me
Gone are all those quiet hours
the same walls every night
a vague friend and one, two neighbors
come here with me ...

Is there still who was wrong
I say you
Will there remain who left home here,
I say you
Was it just me?
Was it just me? <|endoftext|> 
(Willeke Alberti & Ron Brandsteder)

How long have we known each other Ron
More than thirty years
Yes
Yes

It passed
Before there could be anything
(Before we actually realized it)
The desire never comes
There was never any pain

It passed
Two teenagers still in school
(Hmhmhm yes)
Now much more my buddy
(it should be like this)
Then you were my idol
My idol



refr .:
    Friendship, friendship
    Turned out much better
    Was more complete
    Between you and me

It passed
(You had another ponytail)
Before it existed
(And those very little freckles)
You always remained my boyfriend
Evil never did

It passed
And without a trace of regret
(Yes)
I know I felt then
I'll never really lose you
never really lost
(No, it is not)

refr.

It passed
But I feel more now than ever
You belong to my life
No, I will never forget you
Will you never ever forget me?
No. Ron
Okay
Of course not how is that possible
Goodbye dear Wil
Goodbye dear <|endoftext|> 
even though I was queen
of the most beautiful fairyland
that had no value without you
though the whole country donated

me gold and diamond
yet my life was poor and gray
if I didn't own you
then my heart was alone
because I want to be around me
you alone, you know that <|endoftext|> 
Outside the wind howls around the house
The stove is purring at four
There is a string hanging from the letterbox
And there is paper in the drafty cracks
We were very poor
And nobody loved us
But we had tea and no TV yet
But radio and lady fingers
We took a bath
Hair wet, just on
Until father said, "Go to bed"
Then we got a jug
Faces on the wallpaper
But not really scared inside
Luck was common then

Outside the wind howls around the house
And mother knits a warm scarf
And the goose plate was on the table there
The next morning all the way
We also went to the forest
That's where we got lost
Got off the road, made a career
Forget all that pancake flavor
The Netherlands was resurrected
Under Drees. Fanny Blankers-Koen
Won gold in London four times
If you lied, it was a shame
The jigsaw puzzle came
In the third year of peace
Luck was common then



The school bag was the first sign
That the case had already been considered
As far as you are without a sense of duty
Your life suffered, your life suffered

Outside the wind howls around the house
And inside the coal kit was ready
And the sidewalk, on which was played marbles
Was the most important part of the street
And the Netherlands was big
And nobody died anymore
And conviviality hardly knew time
With tea lights from Verkade
We took a bath
Hair wet, just on
Until father said, "Go to bed"
Then we got a jug
Faces on the wallpaper
But not really scared inside
Luck was common then
Luck was common then
Then was luck
(Wasn't it normal?)
Very normal
(Very normal) <|endoftext|> 
It's never too late to make a new life
It's never too late for a kind gesture
It's never too late to quit the old days
And to believe in a future together

It's never too late to live on love
It's never too late to see your mistakes
It's never too late for an evening with your friends
And to rely on a very sincere maybe



Everyone I know has their mistakes now and then
In fact, no one can really live without it
Because you have to learn life
Like me and like him
Climb out of the deepest valley
Then you feel free again

It's never too late to choose life
It's never too late for the supreme goal
It's never too late to give your best
It's never too late for the way of feeling <|endoftext|> 
If you think it is over
I don't love him anymore
I don't want to believe it
But I can hear it in my voice
It can't be that way
And he will end up
Suddenly there is some doubt
When he says goodbye

refr .:
    It's not over yet
    Just stay with me
    There can be only one
    The one that is you
    It's not over yet
    Just stay with me
    There can be only one
    The one that is you



Who could predict you
What you would lose
But you hear yourself say now
I do not love you anymore
One last kiss, some tears
Oh come now you have to go
And he's already at the front door
But you hope it stays

refr. (2x)

There can be only one
The one that is you <|endoftext|> 
My darling I know
You do it work for the kids
And for me and for the second mortgage
I will therefore not hinder you in your work
But it is often seven days a week
Well, you work without looking back
In the sense of all your work and our existence
Just when I'm squeezing the orange juice again
Then you have to go again without drinking

And now you're in the room
But are you there for fun
I'd love to tell you something
Oh darling if only you were here

My dear I know work always goes for the girl
Even though that girl is now a mature woman
When I pack your suitcase for the business trip
And fold the ironed clothes neatly
I think when you fly to all those distant lands
Do you often say when embracing: baby I'm calling
And when I see how our children grow bigger
Then I know darling, time flies



And now I feel you on my body
Quarter to four
I'd love to tell you something
Oh darling if only you were here

My husband, I know a person cannot wish for everything
I also know that you spoiled us time and time again
Then again a necklace or lotion or a CD box
Everything tax-free-shop in advance, planned
But I wonder if you'll think of me
Me in this house and you miles from here
If you attend your interesting business meeting
Quickly thinks how will my girl be

And now I am lying with the other
Warmth, attention and fun
I'd love to tell you
I would love to, dear
But you are not here <|endoftext|> 
(Willeke Alberti & Corry Breken)

Sister you can sometimes tell me too
why it is so sad at home now
Mother does nothing but cry
and always begs forgiveness for you
Yesterday when I saw you walking so chic
and I wanted to go to you
Mother wanted to beat me up
Dear sister, don't you think that's silly

And now we are also going to leave the neighborhood
Mother doesn't want to see the people anymore
Father even growls when we only talk about you
Have you been really naughty?
He also broke the big doll
she was not disobedient
I had only agreed with doll
Writing to you, we are so sad



Sister, I have received your sweet letter
I cried about it all day
I would have liked to fly home like that
if only I was given a place
But you would understand the impossibility
as long as you know the true state
Later you will realize everything
Later when you grow up

Sister, remember that nice boy
who often waited for me on the corner
You came to bring him a note from me
then he gave you chocolate or biscuits
who has, no, I can't tell you
But he was a really bad guy
I hope to explain it to you later
Later, when you grow up

Dad would absolutely kill me
When I got home, because he swore it to me
He no longer wants to recognize me as a child
Yesterday he just passed me
Honey, you'd increase my suffering so much
if you also pretended not to know me
if you too will reject me later
later, when you grow up <|endoftext|> 
I wake up in the morning
with such a vague feeling.
Then I think well, I care
Just let things go.
Take a shower, iron a blouse
Get me in my pants.
And I just go for an afternoon
visiting the monkeys.

Chorus:

Just any day, just any day,
In which you can do anything yourself.
Just any day, just any day
Whatever happens I smile.
Though it pours cats and dogs,
Do I have to share all my blankets
Or they say with so many,
that I can never sing again.
I don't care now
because it's just my day

Or I'm visiting again,
on the ottoman with tea and cake.
I can already see myself
With me its right down a street.
I say skoesie, with an excuse
Come on.
And I take the train at noon
to go to Efteling.



Chorus.

When I come home in the evening after such a day where everything was allowed
Then my husband has been looking for me with everyone everywhere.
don't want a fight I say skoesie
I smile my best smile
I kiss him on the forehead and we walk on yes yes.

Oh what a day, oh what a day
In which you can do anything yourself
Just my day
Whatever happens I smile
Though it pours cats and dogs,
Do I have to share all my blankets
they say it with so many,
that I can never sing again.
I don't care now
because it's just my day
Whatever happens I smile <|endoftext|> 
When you thought "I'm being carried" you had to lug around
When you thought "It's just a swallow", you had to chew
When you thought "I want to quit", just start
And just when you wanted to go out, go in

When you thought "It's too much for me", it got less
When you thought "I am a caterpillar", you turned out to be a butterfly
When you thought you won something, you lost
And when you thought, "Now I'm going to die," you were born

refr .:
    You have to sail on today's wind
    Yesterday's wind does not help you
    Tomorrow's wind might stay out
    You have to sail on today's wind



When you thought "Well it gets better" it got worse
When you thought "I'm giving up", you turned out to be a fighter
And when you thought you were a realist, a dreamer
When you thought "Now it will be winter", it became summer

When you thought "It's being delivered" you had to get it
And when you thought "I'll get something back", you had to pay
When you said "I'm alone", you could hide
When you thought "It's for laughing" you cried

refr. (3x) <|endoftext|> 
Who's taking my place today
That is what I keep asking
I know you say so quickly "I only love you"
Who do you play this game with, do you pledge eternal loyalty
Who is your smile for, for whom
With whom is your heart now, with whom
You said "I want to be free"
And didn't want to be with me anymore
Who's taking my place today

My heart has kept a fairytale
Am I not worthy of your love
If you want to forget, then I can still know
Who's taking my place today <|endoftext|> 
If you are tired
When you are old
When you're shivering and drizzly and cold
When your husband is on the Pier with a Miss again
If conjugal love gets you here
If your in-laws ask for support
When your father holds on to the railing again
When there is snow, when there is fog
When it's icy and your lover is a sadist
If that's all your destiny
And you ask if there is a God
Then bang the doors furiously
Go rip up your cocktail dress
But don't whine

Cry in your bed, bite your sheet
Curse everyone, shout from the rooftops
But don't whine, don't whine, don't whine

Kick around you, never be a lady
And throw the tea set right through the windows
But don't whine, don't whine, don't whine

Take a pair of large scissors and cut the velor
Call the notary's wife a whore
Do all that
Make a big scandal
But don't whine, don't whine, don't whine

When you are down
When you are ill
If you are warped with rheumatism
When the rain leaks through the roof, onto the ground
And your seven kids have a red dog
And not a piece of food in the frigidaire
And the mice fall dead in the greenhouse
If your car hits a pole
When the cat throws up on the mat of the portal again
If you are poor as a church mouse
Must go mop in a workhouse
Yes, anything can happen
Even in technicolor colors
But don't whine



Jump in the canal or cut your hair
Push old ladies off the sidewalk
But don't whine, don't whine, don't whine

Go have a drink, go and gamble
Shoot your revolver at Corry Chunks
But don't whine, don't whine, don't whine

Go to the post office and spit through the counter
Have a heart attack or go to bed if necessary
With the cardinal
Do all that
But don't whine, don't whine, don't whine

Whip your child, squeeze your parakeet
Break into Kok and shout: "You are a sissy"
But don't whine, don't whine, don't whine

Go to Paris, go live
Enter into a relationship with Van 't Reve
But don't whine, don't whine, don't whine

My boy, what a show
Boy, boy, not just
Do all that
With a cannibal
But don't whine, don't whine, don't whine, don't whine, don't whine, don't whine, don't whine, don't whine <|endoftext|> 
Ever since I was seven years old
I just wanted to
Play with the boys in the class
But was it at my feet
Or my hundred thousand freckles
I was not involved with them
And when they went to the playground
Or wanted to jump rope
I had nothing to do with a lolly
But even at about seven years old
Do you also want to experience something
For the very first time I called then

refr .:
    Oh who, comes in my loft
    Nibble nibble little mouse
    Who comes to my house
    Who, oh who, comes into my loft
    Oh who, oh who, will be in my loft

Ten or eleven years later
I hit the same blunder
When a boy smiled at me I thought, "Well
You are watching them nicely "
Until it turned out later
That he just wanted to ask directions
I have never given up hope
Because where there is hope, there is also life
That she was mama, and she married seven times
So I asked in an ad
To an unhappy person
Just like me, if I could be a real gentleman



refr.

I received about fifty letters
Very crazy, very sweet
But one of them stole my heart right away
He said, "That piece in the paper
I always have it at hand
With my pigeons, come straight here "
I've been here for a while now
And don't regret a second
Because once a day I repeat him
Like the pigeons, the boss gets
Late in the evening, very hurry
If I say softly before the light goes out

refr.

Oh who, oh who, will be in my loft <|endoftext|> 
Just say it, I want to know
Sometimes I did something wrong
Did I misunderstand something
It cannot go on like this
Just say it, you have to express yourself
Is there a fight, are you in pain
You are far away as I see you now
While we are good friends

refr .:
    Why that wall around you
    Why do you stay alone
    So withdrawn in yourself
    Don't carry your problems alone
    Two know more than one
    Sharing everything is not wrong

Just say it and I'll know
If I can help you sometimes
Or have you completely forgotten
I've been your buddy for a long time
Just say it, I have to shut up sometimes
Then tell me what's wrong
I would like to gain your confidence
Or is that exactly what you miss



refr.

Together we can conquer the world
And I always stay right next to you
But say what's bothering you
Then you know that I always remain in solidarity
honey

refr.

Why that wall around you
Why do you stay alone
So withdrawn in yourself
Don't carry your problems alone
Two know more than one
Sharing everything is never wrong <|endoftext|> 
What were you doing that Friday in August
When I saw your car in Amsterdam
And what were you thinking when you kissed her so deeply
When she took you in her soft arms

I wanted to leave
Disappear into the sky
Forgotten seeing you
And that I once deserved you

I wanted to go
Far from you
Higher than the stars I ever climbed with you
Why



What did you say that Friday in August
When I asked you in the evening if there was anything
I still feel what quenched our love
The doubt I read in your eyes

I wanted to leave
Disappear from our house
Forgetting you were once my guy
But that you were never meant for me

I wanted to go
Far from you
Behind the rivers I swam with you
Why <|endoftext|> 
(Willeke Alberti & Andre van Duin)

Willeke
Andre
How are you doing
Good and how are you
I haven't seen you for a long time
No, way too long

We don't see each other often, you and me
Sometimes weeks, months pass
We are too busy with ourselves
That goes for you and me

We see each other much less than then
About two or three times a year at most
But old love doesn't rust, you see
We are together again

refr .:
    We always remain friends
    The saying goes that true friendship will not wear off
    You won't lose it all your life
    It's the most beautiful here on earth and it always keeps its value
    We always remain true friends
    The saying goes that true friendship will not wear off
    You won't lose it all your life

Real friends for life
True friends forever



My diary is now in the old house
The mirror image is also hanging there in the hallway
Then I was the bride is over
How long the winter was

Those were good times, it's true
I would like to do them again with you
I wouldn't have missed that, that time
Not for a million (not for a million)

refr.

You stay true friends all your life
You stay true friends all your life
Real friends for life
True friends for now and always

refr.

The saying goes that true friendship will not wear off
We always remain true friends
The saying goes that true friendship will not wear off
You won't lose it all your life <|endoftext|> 
(Willeke Alberti & Paul de Leeuw)

Why didn't you call
I was at home, sitting in my place
Cup of coffee just made
Fresh orange juice, a cigarette
I wasn't even talking

Why didn't you call
You said so this morning
Because you had something to say
That's why you wanted to call me
Well, I wasn't really upset
But why didn't you call
Oh, I don't have to whine
You may have been busy, visiting or absent
Oh, I don't have to whine
We're friends after all

Hmmm hmmmm
Why didn't you call
To gossip, to talk
About what you have experienced
Who has a new love
And who left it



Why didn't you call
A portable is a small convenience
Or did you not have it in your pocket?
Little effort, big gesture
Just chat, then done again
That's why I'm calling now

We talk business
Have nothing to do with us
About love, about bliss, about things that touch us
And we talk about men, about this, about that
We forget and forgive
That only costs quarters

Oh, now don't whine
You may have been busy
Visit or absent
Ohhh, now don't whine
This can happen
So let's not complain
Ohhh, we've been talking like that for hours
How long can the time take

Nice that you called
But it's late, I quit
We have told everything
It is promised, you call
If not, I'll call you again
Ohhhh <|endoftext|> 
The world is shaking and tired, tired of life
Mother nature runs out of breath
How to proceed, where to, where to
Tell me where to

Acidified forests, distress signal, stiff and bare
With branches like charred hands
Beached birds along the beach
Who knows how, tell me who knows how

It has already taken far too long
I just let you go
But now it is enough
It is time for you to understand
That this cannot continue like this
And you certainly won't get a second chance
It is time for you to show your colors
Even though I don't know how to proceed
When you're not with me anymore

refr .:
    Because I really can't live without you
    I can not let you go
    Because my world revolves around you
    You are part of my existence
    I've tried it so many times
    But you didn't know what you wanted
    Even if you told the truth now
    I put my pride aside
    Because I really can't live without you



How often have I been talking to you for hours now?
But I was talking to a wall
The one between you and me
Even now it still exists
Even though I now play my last card
The game has now been played
Then know that there is another queen of hearts
In your poker game exists

I put my pride aside

    It is an easy plant
    He eats out of hand, as it were
    A little fertilizer, a little sun
    He does best on the balcony
    I give a sneak, a sneak, a sneak
    And when I visit in the evening
    Then I bring happiness everywhere
    I give a sneak of the fuch
    I give a cuttings from the fuchsia
    From the fuch, fuch, fuchsia.

Everyone in town
Has already had a hideaway from the fuchsia
Mr. Guard, at number eight
Has already raised twenty-three cuttings

I have learned from previous mistakes
But what you want is really the world upside down
You keep believing in your farce
I also overcome this
And later on healthy again

Even if you continue to believe in my love
Even when a doubting heart takes hold of me
You ask me, stop and reflect
Or start over again
To turn the tide

refr .:
    Don't ask me questions, don't think
    Or never say my life better
    Now that I am faced with the choice
    Preferably to give up
    Don't ask me questions, it's too late
    It makes no sense, the pain will wear off
    Whatever you say, it is empty talk
    No apologies, no blame



If you go

But far too often I let it happen
If anything could be saved, it slipped out of my hand
And you can choose, submerge or hope for a miracle
I choose common sense

Don't ask me questions, don't think
Or never say my life better
Now that I am faced with the choice

My safe haven
My peace, my struggle

    Where is the sun that will warm me
    Where are your arms and where is the source
    Where is the light that will finally shine
    That makes the cold disappear
    I'm looking for your face

The pain has disappeared but the chill remains
I'm waiting for that one thing that will drive away the silence
I'm waiting for a sign, a voice or a word
Who will break this if you only hear me
But



refr.

And suddenly you were there, I saw you go again
I still moved aside but you stood next to me
You kept walking next to me, you went home again
My heart opened again, I feel at home again

You are the sun that will warm me
Your strong arms are my source
You are the light that will now shine again
That makes the cold disappear
I see your face <|endoftext|> 
every time, I get to my head

I am disappointed, outside in the cold
but over and over I think there will be one

with whom I find ... that what I now lack
love forever again and again

every time, strikes what used to be
up again like a flame, from the old ashes

On the way home, yes, then I felt
That without you it was never quite a homecoming
But wherever I am, yes, I know
I feel that you are waiting for me, home, that is for you

I am at home with you wherever you may go
Often it turned out that I cannot stay a week, not a day away from you
I am at home with you, your house is our domain
North or south, it doesn't matter, because where you need to be, I am at home

Where you need to be, I am by your side
Where I go, where I stand, there you are
I would follow you if you wanted to go to Timbuktu
It makes no difference to me, because home is with you



I am at home with you wherever you may go
Often it turned out that I cannot stay a week, not a day away from you
I am at home with you, your house is our domain
North or south, it doesn't matter, I'm where you need to be

I've traveled a lot with you, it's as if I know all of Europe
When we go to Holland, I don't feel like we're going back

I am at home with you, your house is my domain
North or south, it doesn't matter, because where you need to be, I am at home

I am at home with you wherever you may go

If you ask me what I want tomorrow
Tomorrow morning when it's my birthday, what a present
Well I have to tell you I really don't know
I don't have a wish list
So leave it that way

I have glasses and vases in all shapes and sizes
I have posters and photos in black and white and colors
I have more lingerie than I actually like
And a subscription with the best masseur

refr .:
    But would you like to give me a call?
    Because no matter how busy it is tomorrow
    I love to hear you tell about your love
    Your voice is the only thing I miss so much
    Your voice is the only thing I miss so much

Chocolates and cookies and cakes make me fat
There is really no CD that I am terribly looking for
I have body lotions and champagne and perfume
I am dying in flowers and I already have a book



refr.

So if you really really really want to know
What you can really do me a favor with
Then dial my number and wait for me to answer
Pretend you're with me and give me a kiss

Lalalalala

I love to hear you tell about your love
Your voice is the only thing I miss so much
Your voice is the only thing I miss so much <|endoftext|> 
refr .:
    You taught me to love you
    As much as a girl does that only once
    Now teach me to forget you too
    Or come back again and everything will be fine again

When you came to the store to buy that jacket
Then I only saw the customer in you
I thought you were pretty but I didn't show that
But still took a look at your right hand

You weren't married, you didn't have a ring on your finger
And then your voice said something gallant to me
Then I gave the answer, blushing
"I'm free tonight at a quarter past six"



refr.

And then after that day, weeks have come
Where I only thought of you
We made plans together and I had illusions
You know what a girl expects from something like that

But for days you haven't spoken out
I think every day if only you were here with me
Please give me a call or let me know
I'm free tonight at a quarter past six

Mirror image tell me
Am I really your age?
Is it true, I am already sixty
My life is over
I am young, but I am not as young as I was then
I would love to have it here and there
do something over again (about do-o-o-oen)



Mirror image I can hate you
Because you don't give a day back
Why do those years go
When you are young so fast
I am young but there is already so much memory
Mirror image from all those years
I don't forget a thing (no di-hi-hing)

Mirror image my first boyfriend
Was a kid my age
He gave me my first kiss
It was a wonderful moment
I am young but I would love to do that again
Quick quick slow, the first dance class
How green I was
I just have some pictures and they tell me again
All these years are over
they ain't coming woe-ee-lord (not woe-he-lord) <|endoftext|> 
Lettuce, tomatoes and radishes
Young peas, young girls
Young foals, young lambs in the pasture
And the sun on all roofs
On the Amstel with its barges
On Jordaan and Pijp and Vondelpark and IJ



Lettuce, tomatoes and radishes
Westertoren you play tunes
Munt en Dam Palace and Montelbaan are added
Celebrate our steak, tender and lean
At the grinning butcher
Everyone is nice, everyone is happy

Lettuce, tomatoes and radishes
There are little paradises everywhere
Every day a bit of happiness passes by
But because you share it with many
You have to play her little warrior
Or it says 'Ein-my-mutte, you're done' <|endoftext|> 
Sometimes when I see him standing by her
He with her, so ordinary
So naturally together
Then I would like to be with him

Sometimes when I see him go with her
Hand in hand, so ordinary
So naturally together

refr .:
    I find the courage to say it
    How in love I am with him
    Is it okay to tell her?
    That that man I know so
    Who has already taken her heart
    You can also live in my heart
    I find the strength to say him
    How in love I am with him



Sometimes we are on the road together
She with two and I alone
So obviously too much
Then I would like to be her
Sometimes I think "I'm out of luck"
That first time alone with him
He was mine until she appeared
Then I would have liked to be her

I find the strength to say him
How in love I am with him <|endoftext|> 
My mother had a little brother, that was my uncle Jan
And it always came every Sunday afternoon
He didn't like family, he liked kids
He remained a real bachelor all his life

I suddenly got my very first bicycle from uncle Jan
He said "that's for you, joke" and disappeared again
At home it really wasn't a big deal, it was always a party
Because everyone was happy if uncle Jan had been again


refr .:
Because we went on vacation from uncle Jan's money
And nobody seemed to know how he got those pennies
We didn't care so we took it
Nothing to complain about
Not to ask
What fun we had from uncle Jan's money
And that is why everyone was very fond of him
And where he got it from, no one has yet told us
O that dear uncle Jan!

When I got older I quickly got a job
And it became a mystery to me how my uncle had done that
He had no job or inheritance and was just sitting in front of the TV
I saw that when I drove by on my way home from work



I noticed that uncle Jan was behaving strangely
You never saw him with friends or in the pub
He came less and less, but it was always price
Because if it came along, then we could travel

refr.

Now I haven't heard anything for months and I'm looking for him
I find it in a room, lost in a book
And then he tells his story, he reveals his secret
How he managed to be such a good uncle

When I tell him I really love him very much
He gets tears in his eyes and he suddenly shows remorse
It will take some getting used to for both of us
Those steel bars between uncle Jan and me

refr.

Oh that dear uncle Jan
Oh that dear uncle Jan
Oh that dear uncle Jan
Oh that dear uncle Jan <|endoftext|> 
The happiness of our moment
Made me want endlessly
Nothing is so beautiful
As the luck of our moment

Flying like a bird
I dance in the light again
I see with different eyes
Recognize your face again

refr .:
    In my mind I always see our flowing play of body and mind
    Pregnant with that love dance, I was born again
    And I am a woman again, in your hands I feel like a woman
    I feel like a woman, because of your love, I feel like a woman again
    I falter, I am defenseless in your arms



Mmm, mmm, mmm
The happiness of that moment
Enchanted my senses
Nothing is so beautiful
Like the happiness of our moment

You were to be loved
Just like I had to love you
Love and lust
In one breath in your kiss

Because nothing is as beautiful as the happiness of our moment <|endoftext|> 
BEING TOGETHER


My boyfriend, may I have a word with you
Because it confuses me what happens to the two of us
Do you have that too, feeling of fear that creeps over you
When you're alone
Because it's like the days without you are so hollow and almost empty
Do you have that too, feeling uneasy that it won't last forever
Can keep going
Will that doubt remain for us?



refr .:
    Being together
    Is laughing together, crying together
    Living by being close to each other
    Being together
    Is stronger than the strongest storm
    More colored than the gray around us
    Because being together
    Yes be together
    Everyone wants that

My boyfriend, may I hang on to you for a second
Feeling your warmth, even if it's only for a very short time
Do you have that too, feeling of peace that creeps over you
If you look at me
Because it's as if the nights together are so much more and really meant
Do you have that too, feeling of timelessness, that it is forever
Can keep going
Those feelings keep me standing next to you

You taste like the first cup of coffee in the morning
You feel like a bee from a choclat-dipped ice cream
Sometimes hypothermic like a glass of white Chardonnay
But usually hot and fiery like a wild sea of ​​flames
And maybe, yes, very maybe

Because you dance like a flamingo in mating time
You often fight like a tiger in the heat of battle
Sometimes not easy to burn, nice and lazy and nice and slow
But mostly energetic and clear as a wild mountain stream
And maybe, yes very maybe, I'll make you mine



And I will take care of it
That you will always shine
That you will not suffocate, and it
No need to search
In sinister corners
To prove your 'manhood'
Yes, I'll make you feel what it is
To be mine
What it is, mm mm, to be free in love

Makes me blind, site blind
Child who keeps on singing

I sing again and again
It remains theater

Everything will be different soon
This goodbye hurts a bit
I know when I close my eyes
Tomorrow I will be the bride

You smile, but I also see a tear
I'm still your child, it doesn't matter
Tomorrow I will be the bride

This is the best time of my life
The best time I have known so far
I am surrounded by friends and children
Any day, any hour, any time
At the moment there is a plumber working on the job
At the moment a businessman is being spoiled
At the moment there is a firefighter to extinguish
Right now, right now



Right now there is a junkie dealing drugs
At the moment a ship is wrecked on the high seas
At the moment there is a 10 kilometer traffic jam
And the rest of the Netherlands is in front of the TV
At the moment, a big battle is being won
At the moment it is deep night elsewhere
A cowardly lie is being made up right now
And small children are innocently killed
Right now the sun is rising in a very distant country
A mother gives birth to her very first child
At the moment a well in Africa is drying up
While an old man finds his greatest love
This is the best time of my life

And my brother and I wanted to go to the stadium
Yes, the fever struck at noon, Dad got slightly upset

And as a girl I thought well, when I got married later
I don't have all that fuss, I'll take a man who fishes
But fate is capricious because, I married a man
Who is terribly sweet, but also football gossip

Yes and now and then I hear in the house, wer the same as before at home



refr.

And when I'm fed up, I go shopping in the city
With my daughter, because she wants to run away from time to time
And that's great for her and me, then we catch up again
It's nice, we both have the same view
Yes, because now and then she also belongs at home in the same way as before

It's over, you go, you feel free
That dream of ours is lonely and alone
My world is falling apart

Don't ask why, I wanted an opposite
Moments when you said "We two are one"
My world is falling apart

Stay with me, a voice screams inside me
Saying, "I hate you, go away now"



You look at me, I see a stranger
One last look, now I'm really alone
My world is falling apart

You're there now, you say, you love her
Yet I feel that you are standing before me again

Then don't ask my arm for your sorrow
Loneliness, just feel this now alone
Your world is falling apart <|endoftext|> 
You have been with me for years
During the day and at night
I feel a thrill of happiness
When I see you
So unexpected
Without saying anything
We know enough
You go to her
And I to him
It is still too early for us

refr .:
    But in my dream
    The boundary of feeling is not indicated
    An openness of warmth and attention to each other
    In that dream there is rest by not having to think
    Fear turns to safety
    Simply by being you and me

Yet I am whole
Yes, unsure
For that particular day
That he and she let us go
The shine is gone
Because it is allowed



But in that dream
The boundary of feeling is not indicated
An openness of warmth and attention to each other
In that dream there is rest by not having to think
Fear turns to safety
Simply by being you and me

You ask me every night
"Say are you, tight free"
Of course I say "how do you get to"
I like Norman
If you ask if I love you

You know very well that I never wanted you "
I belong to Norman



Norman has such a nice voice
Norman is always adrem

It seemed so beautiful, it went without saying, you and I, and it always had to stay that way
Our happiness could not be broken and the sun would shine for us forever
But suddenly you wanted to leave, it went so quickly and that was a dream

This is how it often goes around you, very unexpectedly, one person no longer sees it
The other stays, the house is empty, the room tells its story late at night
How it was, what he said, but what remained is that dream

refr .:
    My head on your shoulder again, your hands playing with my hair
    We may be a bit older, but we are together again
    My head on your shoulder again, your hands playing with my hair
    We may be a bit older, but we are together again



Happiness is like a flower, plucks it off, hopes it will continue to bloom
You take it in your hand, way too tight, because you don't want to lose it
But after a day in a vase it falls out and what remains is that dream

That empty space in your house, in your heart, thinks it won't come back
And you say wear away, pass away, and you try to forget it
Late at night, phone, "yes, with me, I'll be back for our dream

refr. <|endoftext|> 
The rain is pouring down
Outside the wind is howling around the house
The children have gone to bed
I'm downstairs
The coffee is simmering gently on the stove

It's been two years now
That we had to let each other go
But I no longer wish to live in the past
The past is a country far from here
And I don't cry anymore
And I don't ask anymore
I surrender to the way of the wind
And I don't need anything anymore
Because this time, I follow my heart
With the eyes of a child



You then found your love with someone else
I never thought this could happen
But the unrest and the lashing desire
Brought me further and further from my source

Time was actually all that could save me
But every day took too long
But since I no longer wish to haunt the past
I am never lonely, never afraid again
And I don't cry anymore
And I don't ask anymore
I surrender to the way of the wind
And I don't need anything anymore
Because this time I follow my heart
With the eyes of a child

And what the future will bring
No one knows that
But the way of my heart
Is now my greatest wish
And who knows, then I will get what I deserve
And I don't cry anymore
And I don't ask anymore
I surrender to the way of the wind
And I don't need anything anymore
Because this time I follow my heart
With the eyes of a child <|endoftext|>

I once had great plans
All my dreams came true
Lots of tinsel, lots of men
And I was also the bride
An ideal, a castle in the air
How blinded I was sometimes
Well-intentioned advice
From now on I will blow into the wind

refr .:
    I'll do my own thing
    And don't be tempted
    You miss the point
    Because I know what I'm doing

    All that nagging and seeing that makes me like that
    Very tired

I avoid empty talk

And don't worry about those leaves
I don't like to read it
They chat and they sweat
They have no idea
I feel reborn again
And all my worries are just now

Would this life suit me?
Is my decision a whim?
No, I'm finally growing up now
This is exactly what I want

All those blank questions make me like this
Very tired <|endoftext|> 
I tried my best
And all those years
I have so far
Dedicated to you only
No, it really isn't
That there is another
But there is simply something
And I have to say that

Let me live, let me float
Let me be the way I am
Let me shine, let me fail
Just let me do my thing
Let me live, let me float
Let me be the way I am



I hope you understand
What I feel inside
A feeling that I cannot stop
It wouldn't be fair
If you stop me
Don't be afraid because you're the only man for me

Let me live, let me float
Let me be the way I am
You really have to trust me
Then you prove that you love me very much
Let me live, let me float
Let me be the way I am
Let me shine, let me fail
Just let me do my thing
Let me live, let me float
Let me be the way I am
Let me shine, let me fail
Just let me do my thing <|endoftext|> 
Today it is so quiet on the street
The old man thinks
He sits silently in front of the window
Walled in dirty wallpaper
But then he reads in his newspaper
There is fun fair in town
He used to for years
Played with them in the country and he sang

refr .:
    Come in, come in because in here it happens
    Whether you are poor or rich
    Whether you are big or small
    Do you want to know how it will continue in your life
    Then Sjaan puts the cards as it will be

Hey come on in people, Sjaan is ready with the cards
Please walk on, yes you come
Yes Sjaan is ready, hahaha



Somehow he knows, that old box must be in the attic
What he then sat on in front of Sjaan's tent
Slowly he takes his muset, which is always facing him
And then you can hear very softly how it once sounded
On that box that stood in front of the tent
And now and then his mouth murmurs the words again
The words he knew so well, yes

refr.

Folks, come and see that <|endoftext|> 
Sit in my chair and look at you
How you play with the kids, I'm your wife, what went wrong
You're in love now, I don't know who
Maybe I know her, who knows when I see her what went wrong

refr .:
    You who promised us you who believed in loyalty
    You who would never leave, time has not stood still
    You who promised us you who believed in loyalty
    You who would never leave, never thought I would be alone



The time has come now, you are running away
The children in bed, what are you doing it for tell me what went wrong

refr.

You who promised us you who believed in loyalty you
You who believed in us, you who pledged allegiance
You who would never leave, never thought I would be alone <|endoftext|> 
What I see in your eyes
When you smile at me
Are my dreams from the past
I've been waiting for you for so long
Then I crave madly
According to what my heart has promised me

refr .:
    Because you belong to me
    Yes, you belong to me
    You belong to me with all your heart and soul
    Because what my heart says inside
    Arrives at my head by itself
    Whatever comes
    You belong with me

I always believed
In the value of time
To be able to grow as a person
Without revenge, without regrets
I've treasured inside
What I want to share with you now



refr.

And whatever you do
I'll never let you go
Because without you I am nothing

You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me <|endoftext|> 
Christmas Eve in front of the fireplace on the rug
winter is cold but the coffee is hot
I see a black crow in the snow

A snowman is standing in the field
wait until the sun melts him down
and Santa passes by in his sleigh,
he sees the snowman smiles and waves down.

It's like a picture of Antonpiek
that old-fashioned atmosphere is truly unique
and in front of the pond people are skating,
and excited children's voices echo.

You and I are one together
The whole world against us is no problem
When everyone has forgotten you sometimes
I say: Please count on me
Say, remember, that circus with that lion
At night you woke up with a scream
You liked me being her, someone very close
Someone close to you who could comfort you and said
You and I are one together
The whole world against us is no problem
Because if I didn't see it anymore
Made God of every night
A new day
And, if one of us has to go
The other will be left alone
Please remember, for my consolation
There is only one, and that is you
Then think for a moment, even if you are alone
You and I are one together

And, if one of us has to go
The other will be left alone
Please remember, for my consolation
There is only one, and that is you
Then think for a moment, even if you are alone
You and I are one together <|endoftext|> 
I'm alone in my room
My diary is in front of me
A booklet full of memories
Some are very nice
But others are very sad

Our little story started so well
I first met you that Monday
Then there was still joy in abundance
That can be read in my diary

You gave me the first kiss on Wednesday
I said very definitely "really, you can't do that"
But I didn't want to miss him for a million
That can be read in my diary

refr .:
    Why, oh why
    Not everything continued to exist
    Why did we have to
    Break up
    Why, oh why
    Everything is over now
    Which was so beautiful for you and for me



Because you would be with us on Sunday
My mother gave me a satin dress
She also wanted me to be beautiful
That can be read in my diary

But on Friday before that I got words with you
And I regretted that too late
Because I didn't want to be the least
That can be read in my diary

refr.

Which was so beautiful for you and for me <|endoftext|> 
It's been a long time
But I still remember it so well
I sometimes wonder
Where you are now and what you are doing
I flip in my mind
Sometimes back through time
Then I see those moments again
From early and pure happiness
That first night stays with me
As long as I live
It will never be the way it was
That time never returns

refr .:
    Your first love stays with you
    Even if it has been so long
    You think: it's about sooner or later
    It is something that will never end
    Sometimes I think: are you still thinking about me

I hope you are happy
Probably married
Maybe I have a little bit of the woman you love
What remains is the memory
I keep some images apart
I framed those photos
In the album of my heart
That's how you stay with me even when I turn a hundred years old
And whatever will happen
We stick together



refr.

I don't want to trade you for the man I love
Yet there is something in me
What always is and always remains for you

refr. (2x)

And sometimes
Do you still love me
Do you still think, do you still love me? <|endoftext|> 
Under the wool, the heart so full
Lies little Jantje, sobbing
Moesje is angry and restless
He tosses in the crib
Hands are dirty, he dug a hole
And the gardener chided him
Jantje was not allowed to do that
And she didn't kiss him
Now he sees when he gets sleepy

Ten little dirty fingers
Black as soot on two hands
Ten little dirty fingers
With which he does a lot of naughty
Two big fat tears
Piglets down his cheeks
And he whispers softly, half asleep
Mommy, Johnny will never do it again



Mother also dreams, she looks timid
At d'hemelpoort little Jantje
He stops, then he knocks
With little dirty hands
D'engel, who hears it, opens the gate
And says: "Johnny come in, my child
Are your hands black too, your heart is white as snow "
Then mother suddenly wakes up and finds

Ten little dirty fingers
Black as soot on two hands
Ten little dirty fingers
With which he does a lot of naughty
Two big fat tears
Piglets down his cheeks
And he whispers softly, half asleep
Mommy, Johnny will never do it again <|endoftext|> 
I search for words but tears get stuck in my throat
I cannot say anything, I am speechless with love and I caress
Along the warm body that I share my bed with

refr .:
    And I see with my eyes closed
    The features of your face
    I feel you and I don't need anything else
    Because you make words redundant
    And if I did say something
    Then it was: I love you

I miss the sentences to say that you are everything to me
But deep down I was before you got used to you here
Because I've known you all my life



refr.

Because everything you are breathes love
Your warm breath blows the chill from my skin

And I see with my eyes closed
The features of your face
You caress me and I need nothing more
Because you make words redundant
And if you still wanted to say something
Then say: I love you <|endoftext|> 
You look tired and white
You are worrying, hardly speak
Not a day goes by
That you don't cry with grief
I would like to talk to you
But you no longer respond
Don't get through to you anymore
Whatever I try
More and more often it is as if
You no longer hear or see anything
You keep yourself closed
And you don't listen to me
You seek the silence and the solitude
You don't want anyone around you
It used to be different
But now you prefer to be alone

refr .:
    But if you think you are alone
    Then you were wrong
    I am always next to you
    I thought you knew that
    And even if you seem like a stranger now
    Still, I will stay here with you
    Couldn't be any other
    Because I love you



You don't want help from others
And no longer mine either
Your whole attitude tells me
It's all over
It hurts me to see
That you don't share anything with me anymore
If I can't help then
I hope time heals your wounds

refr.

I love you <|endoftext|> 
refr .:
    Johnny concrete, hey, what are you making me
    Dream again while you would play with us
    Johnny, come on, now I'll count to ten
    One, two, three, who has not left, has been seen

Jantje would like to be king, Ruud Krol and cosmonaut
While he keeps a white bunny in the backyard
He's the best firefighter, tugboat captain
In his heart he would love to be anything
FBI secret agent, protecting the queen
Has the fastest car that wins all races
Prevents a plane hijack, is on TV in the evening
Jantje is looking for an adventure, yes, Jantje is experiencing something

refr.



Lalalalalala, Jantje concrete, Jantje concrete, Jantje concrete
Lalalalalala, Jantje concrete, Jantje concrete, concrete

He goes into the wild jungle with his loyal dog
And, just like Remi, roams the world alone
And this year wins the Tour De France, on his super fast bike
Jantje is the great hero, yes, Jantje stands for nothing

refr. (3x) <|endoftext|> 
Are you tired and lonely
and you seek a little support.
And your friends
your friends leave you alone.
Close your eyes, think of me
I'll be with you soon.
Just relax,
I'll help you through it.

Oh I know, sometimes things go wrong.
Then call and say what's wrong.
I understand you,
it's not your fault.
Do you feel lonely and tired.
I will come to you immediately.
There is somebody
who loves you.



When the sky is about to darken
and the clouds gather together.
And the cold north wind
blows around your house.
Don't get confused
but just call my name
and moments later
am I at your place.

Oh I know, sometimes things go wrong.
Then call and see what is there.
I understand you,
it's not your fault.
Do you feel lonely and tired.
I will come to you immediately.
There is somebody
even if you are having a hard time
still loves you.
When people oppose you
so threatening and silent.
They refuse to know you
but don't let yourself be known.

Oh I know, sometimes things go wrong ... <|endoftext|> 
I am so ready for together
I'm so tired, I'm so ready
One and one is one
I am so ready for fearless sharing
Secret wishes, new people
See razor sharp and clear who you really are

refr .:
    And if you make love to me, own me
    And when you look at me, adore me
    And if you don't want to, ban me
    And if you lose me then catch me

Give me all your tears and anger
And if you are sometimes afraid
Feel safe close to me

I am so ready for together
To stand upright, not to blow
With every breath of wind
I am so ready for that one truth
Who embraces me, who seduces me and
Shamelessly shows who we really are



refr.

Give me all your tears and your anger
And if you are sometimes afraid
Feel safe close to me

I want to burn myself on your fire
Whenever you kiss me
So, allow me
Yes, allow me or leave me alone

After, after, after, after, after <|endoftext|> 
We've come a long way together
For years we labored day and night
We never found what we had enough
What we longed for was always more
We were in a hurry, we ran on
Sometimes we didn't even know what for
Our goal was not a meter closer
What we had together is no longer enough

refr .:
    I miss that time back then
    Sleeping in a tent
    Satisfied with the two of us
    We didn't have a cent
    What have we lost
    In the pursuit of more and more
    We had such a good time
    We were not short of anything
    A weekend at the sea
    Bygone vision
    And through my tears
    I see that time back then



On the way to yet another final station
Blurred our horizons
We kept reaching higher and higher to the top
Everything is remote
Much nicer than close by
I am alone on the platform
Your train is going to a new station
I'm looking for the trace back to where it started
Dearest come back again
To that time back then

refr. <|endoftext|> 
(Willeke Alberti & Simone Kleinsma)

Nothing in the world lasts forever
Nothing stands the test of criticism
But also because of my waywardness
I wanted too much, too fanatic

In retrospect I should have done it differently
Tenderness had no meaning
Waited for me to understand him more
At least now I know who he is

refr .:
    Wasn't it beautiful
    Too nice
    Lovely man
    What a man
    Isn't it madness
    That it cannot be done



Because every time it turns out that he can give more than I can ever give
More certainty
He still lives his life in freedom
I know him too well

No one can always be this close to you
Nobody is on call
As unreachable when I'm with him
That distance always remains an objection
In retrospect I should have done it differently
(If only it had been done differently at the time)
I am now stuck with my own legacy
(Own fault and unwise)
But I was so inexperienced then
(Too bad but now you know who he is)
At least now I know who he is

refr.

How it would go from the start
I could foresee very well
Why pain since then
Wasn't it beautiful
Lovely man
Isn't it madness that it can't be
Because every time it turns out that he wants more than I can ever give
More certainty
He still lives his life in freedom
I know him too well

Took a long time but still understood
I know him too well <|endoftext|> 
refr .:
    He is wearing a cap or hat
    A beret, it looks good on him
    But that cap, beret or hat
    He never takes it off
    He is wearing a cap or hat
    A beret looks good on him
    But that cap, beret or hat
    He never takes it off

What color is his hair now
Well, I guess now
Is it blond, black, brown or bald, like a shrimp
He has curls, he is straight
Is his crown overgrown or recently pruned



refr.

Even though I've known a time now
Uncertainty remains
Although we are almost engaged, I have never seen his head
Sometimes I think "How would it be
Once we are a married couple
Does he keep that hat or cap on in bed?

refr. <|endoftext|> 
The night has been long, too dark and too cold
While you lie next to me, nothing feels really familiar anymore
There must be something that does not just pass away
But if it's up to me, it's not too late for us

The day starts gray again and we are going to do something about it
Because I want more from you than your laundry and a kiss
It's about time, but I don't want to get out yet
I hope I can wake you up, so I caress your bare skin
Is this a new beginning
Will this be the answer to the question
Do you know what I would most like to do today



I'll pack you, I'll take you
We're going out, isn't that an endless idea
Maybe by car or train
The tandem or a flying machine
It's time for two (I'll take you)

I'll pack you, I'll take you
We're going on a trip, isn't that a great idea
To New York or to Paris, perhaps
See Rio or Rome first
To the sun and the sea (I'll take you)

Never let me confuse me like this again
So lonely at first, then so happy
Because what can happen to us
You love me just as much <|endoftext|> 
This is rare what you do with me
How you feel on me
No, nowhere else is it like this
What you do to me
Do you always stay here?
No, no one else
Only you, only you

It's not too late now
This is not over yet
Oh no, it's not over
If you leave me, I won't get over it
Only you, you do this with my heart
Since I got you, nothing apart
Because with you my dreams come true
And I know we are still young
But that doesn't matter no



This is rare what you do with me
How you feel on me
No, nowhere else is it like this
What you do to me
Do you always stay here?
No, no one else
Only you, only you

Baby you hurt me
My heart is racing because of you
Yes I am a monster
Don't want it to be because of you, because of you
When night falls slowly
I keep getting closer
I've been waiting all this time
And I know we are still young
But that doesn't matter

This is rare what you do with me
How you feel on me
No, nowhere else is it like this
What you do to me
Do you always stay here?
No, no one else
Only you, only you <|endoftext|> 
They won't go to bed until morning
They have cause for celebration
The harvest has not been lost this time
It has never been such a good year

Let the wine flow freely
Keep passing the glasses on
They go until the early morning
Tirelessly

Then the singing starts together
About everything they've been through
Are the mandolins going to sound?
Until they go home in the morning satisfied

Tipsy farm boys
Run after all the beautiful girls
You can finally relax
Celebrations are for all the work that has been done

Old feuds are settled
It wasn't really worth it
Life has never been better
Ah yes, they belong together

Let the wine flow freely
Keep passing the glasses on
They go until the early morning
Tirelessly



Then the singing starts together
About everything they've been through
Are the mandolins going to sound?
Until they go home in the morning satisfied

Tipsy farm boys
Run after all the beautiful girls
You can finally relax
Celebrations are for all the work that has been done

A deep silence falls for a moment
One of them sheds a tear
When the bell starts tolling
And the mayor says

Dear people of this ancient village
We have been sharing joys and sorrows for so long
I express the hope that it will always remain that way
I raise my glass to a fantastic year

Singing together starts again
About everything they've been through
Are the mandolins going to sound?
Until they go home in the morning satisfied

Tipsy farm boys
Run after all the beautiful girls
You can finally relax
Celebrations are for all the work that has been done <|endoftext|> 
I hear the arguments and the parties
Crack the third step
I see the stain that never went away
My brother's first cup of tea
I hear the bell if it wasn't broken
The guidance of the light grew old
The old green painted doors
I love it, it is so familiar

refr.
    Goodbye home, bye dear old house
    All in all, I liked you so much
    A warm feeling, a precious place
    A lifetime at the Floraplein

Here I read all your lovely letters
This is where I first loved you
Here I arranged your vase of flowers
I was happy with it as a child
I hear the voices of the neighbors
Their step, the creak of their bed
Their dog, later run over
The gramophone and the toilet



refr.

I bring a plant down
And the mover says; Thanks
I look up behind that facade
Where I laughed and howled
I almost regret my move
But the old house is soon demolished
A car with two men stops
One of which will soon buy the land

Goodbye home, bye dear old house
They say there will be a flat here, with an elevator
But you stand in spite of all your cracks
Imprinted in my heart forever <|endoftext|> 
I gave it
I've tried it
With you to the end
I have invested in that

We know better, it's not how it should be
Words fail in the moment
Want the same thing, I know, but what do we do if

Working no longer works
Talking no longer speaks
Why am I still doing my best
When giving no more gives
When working works no longer works
And talking no longer speaks
Everything can be lost
When giving no more gives

Thousands of sentences
It remains a question
Start over
Or does this end today



We know better, it's not how it should be
Words fail in the moment
Want the same thing, I know, but what do we do if

Working no longer works
Talking no longer speaks
Why am I still doing my best
When giving no more gives
When working works no longer works
Talking no longer speaks
Everything can be lost
When giving no more gives

Take my hands instead of staring at the wine

When working no longer works
Talking no longer speaks
Why am I still doing my best
When giving no more gives
When working works no longer works
And talking no longer speaks
Everything can be lost
When giving no more gives
When giving no more gives <|endoftext|> 
I've already broken my heart once
But I no longer have that fear
Scarred for life
But you colored me in

Because if all roads were to go left
Then you take my right hand
You will go through fire for me
And I'll help you out

The valleys were deep
And yet you are
Still here

Sometimes I don't know why
Is more than the truth
Can lose everything with you
Sometimes I don't know why
You love Me
No doubt when you smile at me
As long as you smile at me



Often said, but this is different
You are different from normal
Hope you never change again
Because we belong together

The valleys were deep
And yet you are
Still here

Sometimes I don't know why
Is more than the truth
Can lose everything with you
Sometimes I don't know why
You love Me
No doubt when you smile at me
As long as you smile at me

Sometimes I don't know why
Is more than the truth
Can lose everything with you
Sometimes I don't know why
You love Me
No doubt when you smile at me
As long as you smile at me <|endoftext|> 
When roses are supposed to be red
And violins sky blue
Why is my heart
Then not for you

I want to feel you so bad
But I can't breathe
Your eyes are staring at me again
And I stare back again

Lost and in love
I am even lost in this song
And with the lights out
I feel at home there again

Have I ever told you
Your voice gives me goosebumps
Pure in every word
Well, you have already heard that



Would you ever be mine?
Are you coming with me?
Nothing changes for me
You are still a picture, in a frame

Lost and in love
I am even lost in this song
And with the lights out
I feel at home there again

I am lost and in love
I am even lost in this song
And with the lights out
I feel at home there again

Lost and in love
I am even lost in this song
And with the lights out
I feel at home there again <|endoftext|> 
I'm looking for you, you don't feel it
I want to, but I don't
It is necessary to see
That it is for a reason
We are no longer in balance
We are growing and it hurts me
Do I still want to be with you?
Your eyes avoid me
And I don't know what the reason is
But we are no longer in balance
Is it too late?

You go to sleep with the light on in your head
I am here, but are you too?
You just talk to your body, give me hope
I am here, but are you too?
Are you too?

If I hold you and you push me away, I'll pull you with me
You want to do it yourself, but come over to me if you don't know the way
Why do you sleep with the light on?
You only talk to your body

Sometimes we stray that far
That it looks like there was nothing
So hold on tight
And say there is nothing better
We fall, but we don't break anything
If I hold you and you push me away, I'll pull you with me
I know you
I know you too
But why is it always like this?



You go to sleep with the light on in your head
I am here, but are you too?
You just talk to your body, give me hope
I am here, but are you too?
Are you too?

If I hold you and you push me away, I'll pull you with me
You want to do it yourself, but come over to me if you don't know the way
Why do you sleep with the light on?
You only talk to your body

Everything or nothing
I don't know if it's all, or all, or all, or nothing
Everything or nothing
I don't know if it's all, or all, or all, or nothing

You go to sleep with the light on in your head
I am here, but are you too?
You just talk to your body, give me hope
I am here, but are you too?
Are you too?

If I hold you and you push me away, I'll pull you with me
You want to do it yourself, but come over to me if you don't know the way
Why do you sleep with the light on?
You only talk to your body <|endoftext|>

Whaddup princess of mine, can I get some attention?
Congratulations on your fifth birthday
You know daddy is always nice to you
But sometimes it is also strict in its approach
I am working so hard for you
Overtime and sometimes I don't see you until late
But I always come into your room
I'll put your blanket right and give you a kiss when you sleep, baby
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true
And show that the world is yours now
You are number one forever
So why go for silver when we know there is gold there?
You can tell me anything later
I don't even care if you're wrong
And I'm not going to accept your friend until he shows me that he is proud of his wife
And I'm talking about boyfriends now
Maybe you will just fall for women
But don't ever hide it from me
Because whatever you do I will love you forever
I love you

It doesn't matter if you're different
A child is adopting or pregnant
I'm okay with everything as long as I recognize that smile
And that you never forget that you are safe in my arms

Forever my little girl
I am so proud of who you already are
I will build a future for you
Yes this love is unprecedented
I give everything for you



I've made a lot of mistakes
And I had to fight for the struggles with mom
And we were not well off
But had enough for your nutrition and your diapers
I have adjusted the situation
Your daddy is a businessman
But it still pains me that I couldn't give you much on your birthday days
But now you can get anything from me
You just have to say what your wish is
I see the fear in your eyes because you distinguish between what is good or bad
Now you're calling daddy to your room because I need to see if there's a monster under your bed
But there will come a time when you realize that the largest monster here on Earth is actually humans
Because the world ain't fair, honey
And people are just going to break your heart
They can do anything but the love we have is really not going to take anyone away from us

It doesn't matter what race you are
Whether you are with a foreigner or a white person
I'm okay with everything as long as I recognize that smile
And that you never forget that you are safe in my arms

Forever my little girl
I am so proud of who you already are
I will build a future for you
Yes this love is unprecedented
I give everything for you

Give everything for you
I give everything for you
Yes this love is unprecedented
I give everything for you <|endoftext|> 
(Beats by Esko)

You told me that chick more than a girlfriend
My answer was always girl you're tripping
Claim the loyalty right from the start
But I have to confess I skipped
You gave me love but I only gave you mess
Have to thank God for choosing me
You were the little garden in my heart, at least my rose
What the two of us had seemed timeless forever

With no excuses I know I raised it up
You had dreams about us, I had dreams about the top
Still can't understand
I know you feel sick
Everything built together
But someone else mocked you, as if it were nothing
Sorry I should have known better
You were there when I had nothing
We ran through the rain together

You earn a lot but never gave it
Be exactly like your ex, now you are where you left off



I know I did everything that couldn't be done
But it is what it is
And you gave love but I didn't care about it
You don't do a hundred, not even fifty
Love became hate and I get it

I did everything for you, yes I told you that recently
Now our roads part in this parking lot

My feeling does not lie
I preceded you when I left you
And was she worth it
What had she there
Because I gave everything but it was not enough
You push but you don't know what you feel
Why am I the one who is paying now
These were not my choices
Know what you left behind
Because I gave everything but it was not enough
You push but you don't know what you feel
Why am I the one who is paying now
These were not my choices
Know what you left behind
These were not my choices
You knew what you left behind

You know you did everything that couldn't be done
This is not what it is
And I gave love but you didn't care
Now you say things but prove it
You don't do a hundred, not even fifty

I did everything for you, yes I told you that recently
Now our roads part in this parking lot <|endoftext|>

    First become more beautiful
    Then it will be fine
    First become more beautiful, only then! "

Maybe, I think very bravely
Will I get prettier
Maybe I'll still flourish
One day
Just like a flower
Like a daffodil
Anyway something
That is gorgeous
Oh, if I do that again
Still experience

Why don't I shine

Why am I not allowed in

Surprised me again

A beautiful swan

The same song over and over

Lived without each other

    I would miss you so much
    If I never saw you again
    Your house is not allowed

    Who is only very recently alive

And since today has the name of grandmother

Can your number dream
I have tried many times
I hope one day I can handle it
May I still come
I've learned my lesson
Who knows, something beautiful will come of it
What was it that inspired me
Not easy to be myself
Oh what was wrong with me



refr.

And since today has the name of grandmother

The phone is answered
I almost put it down
But suddenly a voice that says

I would miss you so much
If I never saw you again
Your house is not allowed
I have a little girl
I love to give it my all
Who has a real grandmother since today <|endoftext|> 
Goodbye Mrs. Vervoort,

Hendrik Haan from Koog Aan De Zaan
Hendrik, how did it go?
Did you leave the tap on?

The kitchen mat a little wet,
Mopped up without delay
So it happens, so done "

    The river takes us back from here
    To that world where my love rests in your arms
    Take me to the sea
    There is room for two
    There at the silver sea and the gold coast

The old beach, the golden sand
Let the waves caress you
Come on, help me get across
There the treasure is buried



refr.

The sun sometimes seems so far away
Because through your tears of sorrow
Do you forget that he always shines
Even though you sometimes don't see him

Take me to the sea, there is enough space for two

As soon as I wake up in the morning I immediately want to take a bath
But first, out of curiosity, I grab the newspaper from the mat
Enjoying the warm foam, so nice just out of bed
I read the morning paper at ease from A to Z.
But I got a little pissed when I looked at the headlines
The umpteenth escape from jail this week
I had to think about that when I got into my dressing gown
I went to see if any mail had arrived

There was a card with greetings from Rio, but the sender was not there
And I thought to myself who oh who oh is sending something like that to me now
I don't know anyone in Rio or anyone who would go there
And I thought to myself who o who o sends me a card without a name

I went to relax with the neighbor on the corner
Before leaving for my weekly visit
That day I had to go to uncle Jan, you probably remember him
Who has temporary accommodation in a heavily guarded hotel
It's just after 1 am when I park my car
And I spend an hour looking, apparently he doesn't live here anymore
The jailer tells his story, making it painfully clear
That my uncle also did something about the dire cell shortage



There was a card with greetings from Rio, but the sender was not there
And I thought to myself who oh who oh is sending something like that to me now
I don't know anyone in Rio or anyone who would go there
And I thought to myself who o who o sends me a card without a name

About seven days later I suddenly received a letter
From my uncle Jan and yes, he still turns out to be just as sweet
He writes: money for vacation is not available for a while
Unless you come to Rio now, that trip you get from me

There was a card with greetings from Rio, but the sender was not there
And I thought to myself who oh who oh is sending something like that to me now
I don't know anyone in Rio or anyone who would go there

We will be together again on Sunday
Then you will come back to me for a whole day
Then it becomes like in my dreams
Then we will be happy all day long
I flax on Sunday, if only Sunday
Cause I'm without you, so lonely and all
Those long days before Sunday
I only feel how I miss you
I only know how much I love you
I keep thinking when I count the days
Oh, that time just went so fast
Because I long for you with all my heart

He comes back at night
Under its own bridge
Because he lives there on the canal for nothing
Without a job and without worries
No family waiting for him
He sometimes works at the market in the city
But he soon thought it was good
Because then he has earned some money
Then he celebrates with everyone

refr .:
    One round, give a round
    Give the world a snack
    Just for fun
    Then life is like that again
    One more round, one more round
    That money is just for show
    And although there is nothing to celebrate
    Then you still get a round of ko

Later that day, a child fell in the canal
Why they had not paid attention
Ko didn't think twice
Saved that little girl
Her very rich father
Came closer, relieved
And gave him a million as a thank you
And the whole crowd already knew then
What Ko was going to do with those money



refr.

It had been a blast to me
The city was turned upside down overnight
But when Ko asked, hey, how much do you get
His money was almost gone

Once the day comes
That you are far from here
Very spontaneously stops
And you just have to think about me
Once the day comes
That I hear my name softly called
And suddenly I see you standing there
I feel my heart skip
And even if you don't say a word
I've heard everything
What you want to say to me

Once the day comes
That we start over together
Where we then stopped
From now on
It will get better



And suddenly I see you standing there
I feel my heart skip
And even if you don't say a word
I've heard everything
What you want to say to me

Where has the warmth of the past gone
The skipping child at the organ man
Whistling people with fun in their lives
Enjoy a beer at uncle Jan's
I miss the atmosphere of that pub on the corner

refr .:
    Where is the heat for each other
    A wink, a smile
    It's such a small gesture
    Put an arm around someone
    He feels that less alone

Whatever we have
It is always too little
A car, a house or a good job
We run, we hunt
That makes grumpy
See no one else in the rush
And it is quiet in the pub on the corner



refr.

Yet I still believe in whistling people
A happy smile or a happy face
Those people who still believe in the future
They do not slam the door for the other
And it gets full in the pub on the corner

    Living together
    Hope together
    If you leave
    Are you free
    Never mind the clock
    Walking further
    Stay awhile
    Close to me

I sometimes wonder
Why I keep fleeing from you
Because if you come too close
Draw the oxygen out of duffyyyyy air
But still I can't live without you
Alone is not for me
And then it goes like a beautiful dream
Beyond that loneliness

I'm always in the wrong row again
There are always forty waiting for me
I spend hours at the till
In a large crowd
At the post office and at the dry cleaner
I'm always in the wrong row again

I used to be hard at work in primary school
I was hardly chosen by any team in gymnastics
There I was waiting for my sneakers in the grass
But I wasn't elected until there was no one left
It was a few years later, new round, new opportunities
Then I went to a dance school where you could learn to dance style
The girls and boys lined up neatly
But nobody came to ask do you want this dance with me

I'm always in the wrong row again
There are always forty waiting for me
I spend hours at the till
In a large crowd
At the milkman and at the butcher shop
I'm always in the wrong row again



I come into a store where you have to draw numbers
Then there are always a few who are stretching their time
Then they are only at seventy and I have number four
And before my turn it takes at least 45 minutes
And do I want to order something in a crowded bar
I'm already very confused by about ten minutes
I'm just standing there signaling, but no one sees me
And whoever sees me says the moment, ma'am, I'm coming

I'm always in the wrong row again
There are always forty waiting for me
I spend hours at the till
In a large crowd
In the cinema, the bar, the bakery
I'm always in the wrong row again

So I fear when I will die later
Get up there in the wrong row in heaven
I can already picture it and I will not lie about it
You drew a number for Peter asking me

I'm always in the wrong row again
There are always forty waiting for me
I spend hours at the till
In a large crowd
At the post office and at the dry cleaner
I'm always in the wrong row again
I always stand w ...

Autumn, the whole city shines with rain

And so sign me up for a quiz
You will win it, the trip or the ton
Nothing ventured, nothing gained

    And with a little luck
    I fly around the world
    By the correct answer
    My dream trip is getting off the ground

    And if possible
    Can I flee from cold Amsterdam for a while

Lights out, people are all inside
Spot on, the broadcast will now begin
I get up trembling and fall down the stairs
And land behind camera two
I tear off my dress because it was a bit too tight
But I win the main prize with it



refr.

I wouldn't get far
I woke up from the cold
To then dream further
From a week away with you
But with a little luck

And if possible
Can I run for a while
From the cold Amsterdam

It wasn't that long ago
That we did everything together
Always inseparable
We have not maintained that
Because the walls we built
Destroyed our love
Now I rarely see you
Things I told you
I'll keep it to myself for now
And I say it will be fine
And I smile when you get up
And you say you still call

refr .:
    But turn around
    Then a world bursts into misery
    Disbelief and regret
    I do not know why
    But even this house that I was so used to
    Is cold and unknown
    Now that you're gone



When I talk to you
Then I want you to see
That I hardly miss you
But when you go I notice again
That it is very lonely here without you
When I see you, it's over
Because what we have is so poor
But it is better than nothing
We don't have to say much more
And no more arguments to settle
And at least that's something

That summer day I was sitting on a terrace with you
That summer day in sunny Amsterdam
A blackbird, hidden in the grass, sang to you
His most beautiful song, I didn't know
What happened to me that day



That one day I will not forget all my life
You saved that one day for me
By magic, when I saw you in your eyes
I suddenly knew that summer day will never pass

No, that summer day never ends <|endoftext|> 
Remember, remember, remember



Deep in my heart I can't be mad at you
I will always be faithful to you
You should know that
Deep in my heart there is only one, that's you
You are everything to me
You will never forget that
Because you are not bad
Whatever another says about you
Liev'ling think about it
Go through life together
Then wear your love from now on
Deep in my heart

Winter was long without your love
Winter was cold without your smile
Since the fall you've been away from me so far from here
Tell me when are you coming again, then it will be summer from now on

Winter was cold without your smile
Come in the spring and give me your warmth as long as I live

I hardly have any questions
And nothing to complain about
Sometimes, it's low tide
But then high tide just as often
I am very satisfied and I feel adored
So actually I am doing very well

But sometimes I suddenly have such a strange feeling that something has to be done
Something fun, something strange, something not that heavy
I really don't have to go to Keukenhof
And not to Avifauna
You know what I'm doing, I'm going to go to the sauna

refr .:
    To the sauna, to the sauna
    That's my favorite place everywhere
    I'll be after you in the sauna
    When all the men saw me like this ... they went crazy



I'll have a glass and a nut
Nice sweating naked
And then I splash blissfully in the icy cold bath
And then again sit in that tropical warm heat
And after a few hours I go out refreshed
And then I am so glad I did that again

Something so nice, something so strange, something not so heavy
I really don't need a psychotherapist
And no croquette with chips
You know what I want, I just want to enjoy it

When all the neighbors saw me like this ... they went crazy
If all my aunts saw me like this ... they would go crazy <|endoftext|> 
I'm on a mountain
To look down
The valley of my past
Filled with so much pain

But all I have
That makes me happy now
Living in the present
I dare to be myself

I had to learn
That you can always try
To show the best of yourself

The fall of my life
From the outside a few years grayer
But deep down so much wiser
Finally the peace I was looking for
The fall of my life
Not as smooth as I once was
But I only now know the truth
Even though I wasted so much time
I am finally blooming



A thousand years ago
Did I still have so many dreams
I knew it was coming
But what, I didn't know

I was young and wild
I wanted to keep going higher
Just upstairs
Far from the grief

I had to learn
To accept myself
And to love the things around me

The fall of my life
From the outside a few years grayer
But deep down so much wiser
Finally the peace I was looking for
The fall of my life
Even though the leaves fall from all trees
One day life will come again
Someday, when you've grown a little older
Everything is in bloom again <|endoftext|>

Ahh, ahh
A moment without you
Only the silence around me
I reach out to you
But I feel so alone

Uhm, it's freezing cold in that osso here
Old cigarettes and empty beer bottles
Shards and tears in the wallpaper
We kick the doors back into the hallway
I read old letters and feel the butterflies again
Suddenly I don't remember why I surf solo
Ask for a second chance in your voicemail
I promise you anything, whatever happens
Start to crack, the small cracks and tears
We can keep everything together except rest
We talk for days and years, but let karma determine, ey

A moment without you
Only the silence around me
I reach out to you
But I feel so alone
Only your breath makes me live
You have given a little hope
A moment without you
A moment without you

Uhm, how many times do I have to carry water to the sea?
More and more often it is tears that empty me
I do not fall asleep until later
And more and more often started, but nothing finished, no
So follow [?], So many times have I brought you back
You keep the Merry, so many times I took the bus
I miss your nails in my back, that made me happy
I miss your voice in the shower, it calmed me down
Now process and forget (What else?)
Live and let live (What else?)
Come sit, let's talk for a moment (Let's get a nap)



A moment without you
Only the silence around me
I reach out to you
But I feel so alone
Only your breath makes me live
You have given a little hope
A moment without you
A moment without you

I can not live without you
Without you, nothing to give
Without you
Without you, I miss you for a moment
Without you, stay in my life
Without you

A moment without you
Only the silence around me
I reach out to you
But I feel so alone
Only your breath makes me live
You have given a little hope
A moment without you
A moment without you

I can not live without you
Without you, nothing to give
Without you
Without you, I miss you for a moment
Without you, stay in my life
Without you <|endoftext|> 
Here comes the militia
With banners and with feathers
They are lining up
They chew on her plums
What are their sas
It's as if their noses are curling
They are in step
Like sweet sweet boys

refr .:
   Here come the shooters
   There they come an
   The male sputters of Rotterdam
   Oh what a glitter
   What guts they make
   That comes from the bitter
   And a sense of duty

A shooter is a customer
Which no one can already bomb
Do you dare, asks the sergeant
Come here without shoes
Then he answered politely
Sergeant are you narrow-minded
If I don't have shoes
Then I shoot clogs

refr.



When the General
The troop bids silence
Then a cheeky shouted
You just look at your own
You can be mine
Well run to the thunder
If you hit such a tone
I'll never come and buy your cheese again

refr.

The shooter is the picture
In the Dutch nation
But that bored him
You can tell that from his face
He never spilled blood
He prefers to be next to his weapon
For fatherland and prince
Yawn for about three hours

refr. <|endoftext|> 
How long, what for
Will I be what should be
What you want me to be
The sea that refuses no river
Don't say no, take me


refr .:
    So much to give
    Inextinguishable, my being
    Understand me, you are wrong
    You drown by my zest for life
    Grab me, drag me along
    Dance me crazy, dance me wild
    Dance me hot and dance me wild
    Let me scream with desire
    To that one thing, to that real thing
    See my hell, know my heaven
    Feel my strength and know my pain
    Let the love flow in
    Let it come, dance with me



Lailalailalailai ....

Don't ask me for more than I can be, I want to be
Elusive, accessible, the wind blows every leaf with it
Lifts me up, takes me

(from "Red Sien)

Carolien, I want to make love to you
Carolien, I like you
Carolien, my heart is on fire
Soon I'll lose my mind

Caroline is a woman
Which everyone wanted
But she shares as you know
Only with a hair of joy and sorrow
All men are sorry
That that sweet nice girl
No more can be found for a kindness
And they now sing every day I hear
All in unison for her



Carolien, I want to make love to you
Carolien, I like you
Carolien, my heart is on fire
Soon I'll lose my mind

After a decade or so of pain
Don't you ever sing that chorus again
The same song every day
No I don't like something like that
Well, what did you want then
Do you want another, dear man?
I don't think you can bear that
Are you crazy girl, even if you showed me ten women
There is only one Carolien for me

Carolien, I want to make love to you
Carolien, I like you
Carolien, my heart is on fire
Soon I will lose my fresh ...
Soon I will lose my fresh ...
Soon I'll lose my mind <|endoftext|> 
I love me
Never hear you sing
I love me
Never said
But I love me
I'm going to sing anyway
Because I love me
Mine alone
And I really mean it

I love me
Because I can be trusted
I love me
I can count on me
I love me
At least I can rely on me
I love me
And I will never let go

I stay with me
And not for a moment
I stay with me
Forever and ever
Am even prepared
Give my life for myself
I stay with me
Until death do me part



I love you
I sometimes say
I love you baby
And I really mean it
But I love you I say
Just in front of the mirror
That's how I love you
Back to myself

I love me, love me and no one else
Because I am by far the nicest I know
I don't have to change myself for me if necessary
I love me just the way I am

Because I love you
Usually means
Honey here you have my problems, solve it
I live in hell
And expect heaven from you
Yes, you are giving hell away
Thank you, fuck off

Because I love you
Is not the key to the other
But I love me
Although it sounds blunt and bad
Because who loves himself
That really gives something precious
If he I love you
Says to another <|endoftext|>

carolientje, carolientje, carolientje wants a man
carolientje, carolientje, never gets enough of it

Carolientje was a virgin of barely 18 years old
who wanted so badly to be married, her trousseau was ready
she got hold of a man, a gray captain
she soon handed the pipe to maarten, because she hugged it nicely

[refr.]

the second had a pharmacy and guilders in the bank
but suddenly the third week he became terribly sick
the pills from his shop that Carolien gave him
they made him more and more pale and that's how he put it off

[refr.]

(lalalalalala lalala laalalalalaa)



the third was an aviator who flew his machines
ten thousand meters up and he was never seen again
now she is crying sadly, already for her aviator
but two handsome friends left it as a souvenir

[refr.] (2x)

the fourth had a bungalow and always had a dry throat
She liked that country house so much, so she gave him too much
on whiskey, beer and brandy, his liver gave up
when she had inherited everything she took a drink there

[refr.] (2x)

(lalalalalala lalala laalalalalaa)

Carolientje is now 80, her sex appeal disappeared
sometimes it gets too powerful for her, she wants men around her
even if it is under wagon lake or under coal dust
and then she has to lure one out of the old men's house

[refr.] (3x) <|endoftext|> 
I'm a stranger here
I left my country
I crossed your path
I followed your trail

You said go back
Do not trust me
But you're a part of me
What do I do without you

And I know the future is uncertain
And the darkness is near
And I know we're waiting for a long journey
Right through the desert
Right through the desert

But your country is my country
Your people are my people
Your language is my language
Your God is my God
Your dream is my dream
Your path is my path
Your future my future
Your heart in my heart

I know your people are scared
For us who are different
But I will build bridges
Where the abyss is



And I will long back
When the wind will blow
What comes from the south
From my birth ground

But I will be strong
And I will survive
Because I want to stand next to you
Even if it will be difficult
Even if it will be difficult

But your country is my country
Your people are my people
Your language is my language
Your God is my God
Your dream is my dream
Your path is my path
Your future my future
Your heart is my heart
Your part is my part
Your bread is my bread
Your life imy life
Your death is my death

And when the dark comes
And your people evade me
Will i give my love
Until the hatred disappears
Until the hatred disappears

Because your house is my house
Your anxiety is my anxiety
Your silence my silence
Your country is my country <|endoftext|>

You brought your things
But my heart is still here
And while I was dreaming
Have you seen a different light

You brought your winter into my summer
Without any consultation
You leave me here broken
I am alone and you are gone

Why did I let it get this far
Why does this happen to me over and over

If you regret calling in the morning
Your number is gone and so are our photos
For the time being it still hurts
But I can manage without a fight
No this is not my first time
There are many more of you
So here I go again
Your number gone and our photos too



We are now months on
The damage has already been done
Don't worry about me anymore
And no I don't have to see you

So keep your text messages to yourself
And please don't call me
You're a little late to talk
If only you had foreseen this

Why did I let it get this far
Why does this happen to me over and over

If you regret calling in the morning
Your number is gone and so are our photos
It still hurts for a while
But I can manage without a fight
No this is not my first time
There are many more of you
So here I go again
Your number gone and our photos too

If you regret calling in the morning
Your number is gone and so are our photos
For the time being it still hurts
But I can manage without a fight
No this is not my first time

Your number gone and our photos too <|endoftext|> 
Hi, I had to talk to you
It's been so long
My feeling is still fresh to you
O-o-oh even though I know better
Can't forget
I can't let you go

If hearts could speak
Oh, you should know
Anything it would tell you
O-o-oh keep breaking it
Stay in the past
What have you done to me?

It's hopeless
Storm in my head
Always ends back with you

Hello to me, do you sometimes think about us back in time? (hey, ey, ey)
Because I do
You stay here in my heart forever (hey, ey, ey)
You moved on and I changed too
Still, I don't want any more
Hello to me, do you sometimes think about us back in time? (hey, ey, ey)

Can I give you a call?
You really have to tell
That it wasn't over yet
O-o-oh war with myself
Heart that beats faster again
When I think about your smile again



It's hopeless
Storm in my head
Always ends back with you

Hello to me, do you sometimes think about us back in time? (hey, ey, ey)
Because I do
You stay here in my heart forever (hey, ey, ey)
You moved on and I changed too
Still, I don't want any more
Hello to me, do you sometimes think about us back in time? (hey, ey, ey)

It never went out
So I give myself up
More than I would ever give

But it is hopeless
Storm in my head
Always ends back with you

Hello to me, do you sometimes think about us back in time? (hey, ey, ey)
Because I do
You stay here in my heart forever (hey, ey, ey)
You moved on and I changed too
Still, I don't want any more
Hello to me, do you sometimes think about us back in time? (hey, ey, ey) <|endoftext|> 
No fake smiles from now on
I don't need heels, wear my sneakers again
From now on I will only listen to myself

Night feels longer than before
I don't know if I still belong here
Hold on, we have to get through it
What keeps me here for 45 minutes
The clock is ticking hard and this hurts
Is this the place I need to be?
After all the conversations with myself
I have nothing now, give me something

Love me, I can't do for you
With my heart in my hands, but where to?
If I give you more, you no longer know how
Have you ever known, have you forgotten?

How you gotta love me
From far and up close
Without the fear and the pain
Have you ever known?
How you gotta fight for us
No more salt on the wound
Continue until you could no longer
Have you ever known, have you forgotten?

After all this time, here alone
I can no longer ignore it
Admit it, this is a problem
But don't deny it
Lose myself, I can't go through with it
How you don't know is all I hear
Give me more, what are we still doing it for?
Give me something



Love me, I can't do for you
With my heart in my hands, but where to?
If I give you more, you no longer know how
Have you ever known, have you forgotten?

How you gotta love me
From far and up close
Without the fear and the pain
Have you ever known?
How you gotta fight for us
No more salt on the wound
Continue until you could no longer
Have you ever known, have you forgotten?

Fight for me, fight for me
Fight for me if you still love me
Fight for me, fight for me
Fight for me if you still love me

How you gotta love me
From far and up close
Without the fear and the pain
Have you ever known? <|endoftext|> 
Take me away from here
To a world for the two of us
Where no one asks where we are going
No, no one around us

No money is needed to love you
No nothing is necessary to be with you

You and I together in all countries
Because only with you I want to be there
No one who bothers us or ever changes us
Only with you, only with you I want to be there

I only want with you, only with you
I only want to be in the world with you
I only want with you, only with you
I only want to be in the world with you



Get away from every day
Where no doubt can touch us
Where I have you for myself
And you will never leave me

No money is needed to love you
No nothing is necessary to be with you

You and I together in all countries
Because only with you I want to be there
No one who bothers us or ever changes us
Only with you, only with you I want to be there

I only want with you, only with you
I only want to be in the world with you
I only want with you, only with you
I only want to be in the world with you

You and I together in all countries
Because only with you I want to be there
No one who bothers us or ever changes us
Only with you, only with you I want to be there <|endoftext|>

Yes, those men talk but don't get jealous
I have a crush on you, tell me what you gonna do
What I am wearing below is not underwear
Show you that I do those things differently
Do you dive into my ocean, do you stay on course?
Honey, put your hands on me, I'll tell you what to do

Put me on your lap, oh-oh-oh
Expose myself, oh-oh-oh

She just wants to roll with a Don Dada
She already knows what it is, pu pull up in a whip

Slow down, tranquilo
Not there, it has to be here

Sabe que yo no le quito la mirada
Es como una meta, la tengo fijada
Me sonríe, finge que no le intereso
Pero me voy a quedar con todo eso

Yo tengo mas calle de lo que ella maña
En la pista nadie lo hace mejor
Es como una bomba de alta presión

Tu y yo, oh-oh-ooh
Hasta cuando, oh-oh-ooh
Sexo y alcohol, oh-oh-ooh
Pega aquí, pega aquí, pega aquí

Ai, ai, I'm prepared
I have plenty of time
Ai, oh, I'm going offline for you
Da-dale que tengo ganas de
Far como tu me bailas, ven
Vente acercando mami
Tengo algo para ti <|endoftext|> 
Oh beware I get grumpy
Kapsones because you are enthusiastic
But I stand here as I am
The bum as you know me
Oh beware I get grumpy
Your look already gives away a lot
You stare at me what I'm doing
You want me to give in to you
For you here in this bright light



That fearful feeling keeps creeping over me
It's weird that feeling but you got hold of me
Ohohoh beware I am getting harsh
Desire for you is so great
I am not hard and not made of stone
I want many more around it
I want to but not alone with you

That fearful feeling keeps creeping over me
It's weird that feeling but you got hold of me
Ohohoh beware I am getting harsh
Kapsones only because of you
Because whatever I do
Fair enough
Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Just because I love you <|endoftext|> 
In the summer all trees rustle
The nightingale sings in the foliage
What else can you dream of
A little love for everyone
What else can you dream of
A little love for everyone

So many people live on the earth
And everyone has a native language
What else is there to wish for
A little love for everyone
What else is there to wish for
A little love for everyone

Cool streams flow from the mountains
And from heaven comes a sunbeam
What else can you beg for
A little love for everyone
What else can you beg for
A little love for everyone

In the world you hear so many girls
And most of them are so musical
What else do you have on your list
A little love for everyone
What else do you have on your list
A little love for everyone



There are large pike in the ditches
And in the sea the electric eel
What else do you have to look for
A little love for everyone
What else do you have to look for
A little love for everyone

There are so many days in a life
Thirty thousand in total
What else do you have to ask
A little love for everyone
What else do you have to ask
A little love for everyone

Millions of butterflies and dragonflies
A rainbow, a beautiful story
What else did you want to order
A little love for everyone
What else did you want to order
A little love for everyone

Your own baby with ruddy cheeks
And seven sweet apples in a bowl
What more can you ask for
A little love for everyone
What more can you ask for
A little love for everyone <|endoftext|> 
Sylvia's mother says
Sylvia is still sleeping
She's not answering the phone now
Sylvia's mother says
Sylvia is now learning
To stand on your own two feet
Sylvia's mother says
Syl is going to leave
Better if you just let her go
And I'm looking desperately
All my pockets
To even more quarters

refr .:
    Please Mrs. Van Straten
    I want to talk to her for a minute
    I promise you, I'll do it very quickly
    Here you go, miss
    Because how long does goodbye take

Sylvia's mother says
Syl is happy
There is nothing left that binds her here anymore
Sylvia's mother says
Syl is so young
She's really just a kid
Sylvia's mother says
You have your life
I'm sure you will find another girl
And I'm looking desperately
All my pockets
To even more quarters



refr.

Sylvia's mother says
Syl has moved in
In a place where the sun always shines
Sylvia's mother says
I know what it is
When someone you love disappears
Sylvia's mother is thinking
She deserved better
She came to her end much too young
And I'm looking desperately
All my pockets
To even more quarters

Please Mrs. Van Straten
Let me talk to her for a minute
I promise you, I'll do it very quickly
Oh please ma'am
Because how long does goodbye take
Farewell
Farewell
Farewell <|endoftext|> 
When I got home the door was locked for me
And you pretended you hadn't heard anything
Now you say my love the lock was broken
Now you say come in and walk on
But now I am afraid that I will interrupt

CHORUS:
You lied to me like I was a kid
Believe you thought I was completely blind
Say honey do you think you can handle me
Hey honey you're up to a lot then

When I got home there was no more bread in the cupboard
And you said I can't do anything for you
But now you have even sold all your rings
And comes asking me for money
You must have forgotten about that time



CHORUS

Oh, you're not yourself now
You suffer from grief
And you say you love me anyway
You say you're still my wife
But you left me nice in the cold

When I got home there was no more room in your bed
And you said oh well you sleep on the couch
Now you've kicked your friend out of your room
And you mix my favorite drink
But I think I will thank this time
Screw you...

CHORUS <|endoftext|> 
Not for a while, don't keep hunting for the answer
Don't you know you get lost in all those questions
Not for a while, no for a while

Don't you know, look at your hands because you're already holding it
Don't use your eyes, just feel
You know if it really suits you

There is always a reason not to do it
I've known for a long time when I think back to then
When I stopped looking I found it

When you're there, my head is quiet
And I don't want anything from you, nothing at all from you
When you're there, my head is quiet
And I don't want anything from you
But stay a little longer, stay here a little longer



Don't you know, the grass isn't greener at the neighbors
Don't you know, there is no paradise behind the walls
Don't you know, our time is now and here

There is always a reason not to do it
I've known for a long time when I think back to then
When I stopped looking I found it

When you're there, my head is quiet
And I don't want anything from you, nothing at all from you
When you're there, my head is quiet
And I don't want anything from you
But stay here a little longer

When you're there, my head is quiet
And I don't want anything from you, nothing at all from you
When you're there, my head is quiet
And I don't want anything from you
But stay here a little longer

Not for a while, don't keep hunting for the answer
Don't you know that you get lost in all those questions
Not for a while, no for a while <|endoftext|> 
I don't feel like being alone
I want others around me
The circle around me is much too small
Yes now beware
No one is holding me now

I've wasted too much time already
I had no idea about that
I grew up so neatly
Move it aside
If necessary, things get out of hand

refr .:
    I grab my coat, tie my shoelaces
    My head up, my nose in the wind
    Get my coat, tie my shoelaces
    And I don't care what anyone else thinks

I disappointed myself
I thought we'd do it together
If you hadn't canceled me
Time stood still
But now I know what I want



refr.

Fly free like a bird
Freedom is for everyone
Which fights for you
Is your right
It's time for you to say
Grab your jacket, tie your shoelaces

I don't feel like being alone
I want others around me
The circle around me is much too small
But now watch out
No one is holding me now

I grab my coat, tie my shoelaces
My head up, my nose in the wind
I grab my coat, tie my shoelaces
And I don't care what anyone else thinks
I grab my coat, tie my shoelaces
My head up, my nose in the wind
I grab my coat, tie my shoelaces
And I don't care what anyone else thinks <|endoftext|> 
Are you over fourteen years old
And society says oh look at it
Rules and laws, I have to live by them
Chances are not given to me
Schools and bosses keep me small
Would there be an answer for me questions

Because I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored
And I am so bored in Amsterdam-Noord

They call me a vandalist
But if everyone knew one anyway
What it is like to live in the North
It takes a long time to get to the city
Few pubs, no cinemas
Only a telephone booth, we will demolish it

Because I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored
And I am so bored in Amsterdam-Noord

A sleeping concrete, yes that's north
An uninhabitable place for young people
What we now want to argue for
Your own space with activities
Independent living and jobs
A cinema and not the last



Because I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored
And I am so bored in Amsterdam-Noord

Because I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored
And I am so bored in Amsterdam-Noord

Government you have heard it now
Jan talks about Amsterdam North
Don't stick around, get over the water
Do something now and not later
Finally get us under the roof
You have known about all the plans for a long time

Because I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored
And I am so bored in Amsterdam-Noord

Because I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored
And I am so bored in Amsterdam-Noord <|endoftext|> 
Cycled along the Lindengracht
Thought I saw you walking and waved
It made me dizzy unexpectedly
The fall was soft, it was as if everything turned
I still had the steering wheel in my left hand
On the phone I swam quickly to the shore

refr .:
    Say Carolien you may have seen me too
    If only for a little while
    Say Carolien you may have seen me too
    I would give my life for you

Ran along the Lindenlaan
I saw you go I've looked at you
That tree has not moved aside
He has not moved an inch
It was as if the sun suddenly disappeared
Because everything got so dark around me

refr.



You now live in the Lindenstraat
I crept on my knees along the walls
I don't believe it will go away
I've been peeping through the cracks for a long time
And suddenly a guy came out of the dark
"You come along with uncle cop"

refr.

Cycled along the Lindengracht
Thought I saw you walking and waved
Ran along the Lindenlaan
Did you see? I looked back at you
You now live in the Lindenstraat
Don't believe it will pass

Carien ah Carolien
Carien ah Carolien
Carien ah Carolien
Carien <|endoftext|> 
It had to happen some time
You weren't so young and spry anymore
Everyone you knew shouted he was slow
Are you tired or are you sick?
But still, well I just buried you here
I immediately feel that I miss you
I always laughed at those pet addicts
But such a faithful four-legged friend is the best thing there is

The house is so empty without you
Without you wagging and barking
Everytime I come in and you're not there
Believe me or not it really is a punishment
People who know me ask what's wrong with you
And when I answer I turn red
Then I say maybe I'm a bit sentimental
There really is nothing serious about it alone
My dog ​​is dead

When I think about those many months again
That I could shoot you because
You had to go out again if necessary or I had to fetch for you
But now that you are no longer there, there is a hole
People immediately say buy a new one
Then you will be over it the fastest
They should hang that kind of people
There was only one animal like you



The house is so empty without you
Without you wagging and barking
Everytime I come in and you're not there
Believe me or not that is really a punishment
People who know me ask what's wrong with you
And when I answer I turn red
Then I say maybe I'm a bit sentimental
There really is nothing serious about it alone
My dog ​​is dead

I'm just leaving you alone now
I have to get back to work this afternoon
For the last tribute to your dog
You just don't get a day off

The house is so empty without you
Without you wagging and barking
Maybe I'm a little sentimental
There really is nothing serious about it alone
My dog ​​is dead <|endoftext|> 
I still have to tell you about a time ago
That people were slaughtered like cattle
Being driven together in a camp
The world was burning, it was a disaster
With syclon-B together in the bath
But will it ever pass darling?

People were lifted from their beds
These fought together in the resistance
They fought in the dark and the night
Even those you didn't expect it from
They were so fed up with the oppressor
But will it ever pass darling?



The freedom in which we live is called democracy
But it also leaves room for the neo-Nazi
It is a bad disease, it continues to grow
Friends of ours are murdered every day
I do not fall asleep, it remains a dark leaf
Oh but will it ever pass darling?

The question now is what will bring us in the future
I will remain vigilant until she gives us peace
But if history repeats itself
Then keep hoping and don't think I'm failing
The future is not a dark hole
But will it ever pass darling?
But will it ever pass darling?
But will it ever pass darling? <|endoftext|> 
Verse 1:

The cold has come.
Trees become bare.
Dark clouds.
Soon the snow will fall from the sky.
Leaves are falling.
Soon it will be winter.
Storms and rain
we can stand.
Oh, what a wonderful time.

Chorus:
Winter is back in the country.
We are no longer on the beach.
We put on warm coats.
And skate on the track.
The snow that falls around us again.
Santa is back on his feet.
And children play in the streets with their sleds.



Verse 2:
Is warming me up.
With you in your arms.
Close to the hard fire.
Oh, how cozy that can be.
Candles that burn
and glasses filled with wine.
Reaching hands,
closer ties.
Let it always be that way.

Chorus. <|endoftext|> 
When I was little, my father first took me to the pub
The warmth and joy said enough to me from that moment on
Everyone counts equally in an Amsterdam cafe
Whether you are rich or poor, everyone has their troubles, it remains the same

refr .:
    Where can it be as cozy as in the evening on the Rembrandtsplein in Mokum
    Go in at every pub, from 't Leidseplein to the Jordaan in Mokum
    Amsterdam, your vibrant heart, so full of life
    Rich and poor, white and black, you have given shelter
    Very long, Amsterdam



Every Amsterdammer has a local pub on the corner of the street
There it is with his friends, it does not matter what is being talked about
The weather or politics, Orange or pop music
He is in his element, so he is bound to order a tour for the entire tent

refr.

There is Mokum
Yes, as Mokum <|endoftext|> 
I was born in Amsterdam, three high at the back of the Bloemgracht,
where you could hear in your nest, as a neighbor, Heilie made snachs.
The streets were for play, we roamed all over the city.
We still believed in fair sharing, stealing apples from the market.

Hey Amsterdam, they say you've changed
Hey Amsterdam, you can't do any good anymore
but whoever says that is not an Amsterdammer, because Amsterdam
you are just like then.

And when you come back after a lot of years, they say "Mokum, that's dead."
But I don't believe any of those stories when I walk through the city like that.
The merchants are still busy, De Nieuwe Dijk busier than ever.
I see a kid stealing apples, no Amsterdam never changes.

On a Sunday afternoon to the Red Light District, and if you walked slowly you saw more,
Inconspicuous all together, the Stoofsteeg up and down ten times.
And Sunday night it was fighting, it didn't matter against whom, until the
police then came to breed, then we fought against that one



Hey Amsterdam, they say you've changed
Hey Amsterdam, you can't do any good anymore
but whoever says that is not an Amsterdammer, because Amsterdam
you are just like then.

That drunk guy lying in the porch and my mom doesn't thirst
to him. When Pa asked if he was sick sometimes he said: "No,
just tired. "So that much hasn't changed, junkie now lies
in the porch and next to me an Amsterdammer asks: "Hey Har, is he
well tired, or is he sick? "

Hey Amsterdam, they say you've changed
Hey Amsterdam, you can't do any good anymore
but whoever says that is not an Amsterdammer, because Amsterdam
You're just like then, because stranger junkies riots, they don't scare us
They can tell us more, it's all part of Amsterdam

Hey Amsterdam, they say you've changed
Hey Amsterdam, you can't do any good anymore
but whoever says that is not an Amsterdammer, because Amsterdam
you are just like then <|endoftext|> 
I have prayed that we should learn.
that we must join forces.
These are the hours in which we must turn.
that all injustice should not continue like this.

don't say you didn't never know.
don't put your head in the ground
in the darkness there must also be light.
1 word you understood.

High in the sky are the stars that know,
deep in the sea there lies the great secret then let us search together to find it.
I've prayed that it may be true.



instumental solo

I saw in a dream that all the people on earth,
Living happily together without violence.
Nothing in the world is of greater value. no one is ever struck down by war again.
Power is then over.
but only peace,
would be there for you and me too.
The future is not far from the present war is over.

I have prayed that we should learn.
That we must join forces.
These are the hours in which we must turn.
That all injustice should not continue like this. <|endoftext|> 
refr .:
Leave me alone with all my grief
Better not see people now
No one, no one, no one who can comfort me
I lost my future and my purpose
Leave me alone with all my grief
A smile becomes pure parody
Someone, someone, someone who was happy
And lost, understand what I'm feeling now

There is his last glass
Some cigarettes, his last bouquet
And I feel his hand on my shoulder
And his voice: "everything will be okay"
But I can't believe that
Because this farewell was very different from before
This was final, I am now alone
And I loved him so much

refr.



"Well, it happens quite often
Soon your smile will come again
Have you forgotten?
Everyone around me says that
But I know that is not true
These tears don't dry
This feeling never passes
Because sadness for true love
Is too heavy to carry
Because he doesn't love me anymore

Leave me alone, don't nag at me
I miss it, the wound is still too fresh
When I'm alone I feel him close

refr.

Leave me alone <|endoftext|> 
The world is a carousel
Often life is just a game
And that includes some joy
Dance with me, sing with me
Dance with me, sing with me

What could be more beautiful this night
Then you can sing and laugh
Free yourself from all worries
Dance with me, sing with me
Dance with me, sing with me

refr .:
Sing lalalaa laalalaa lalalaa
And dance with me all night
Sing lalalaa laalalaa lalalaa
Grab the luck while it smiles
Sing lalalaa laalalaa lalalaa
And dance with me all night
Sing lalalaa laalalaa lalalaa
Grab the luck while it smiles



Hear that music full of joy
So don't sit still, use your time
Because this night will be over in no time
Dance with me, sing with me
Dance with me, sing with me

refr.

Laa lalalaa laalalaa lalalaa
Lalalalaa lalalalaa
Lalalaa laalalaa lalalaa
Lalalalaa lalalalaa <|endoftext|> 
She stood before me with all her wild charm, how beautiful she was
I wanted to leave but she was already in my arms, I became her prey
It was so dark in the street when she wanted to dance with me
For a moment I thought "girl I hate you", but then it was already too late
They were wonderful hours that I can never forget
Because she was the woman who made me feel like a man again

refr .:
Agatha, I want to forget you, Agatha
You are fatal, desirable
There is a word you don't know and that is "faithful"



But now that I'm gone I keep thinking about those hours of quiet happiness
But something like that can't last longer with you, then it breaks
It's a world full of illusions you can give to any man
But it ends with arguments and then he runs off
But I can't forget you even if it's too late
Because you were my queen there with those girls in the street

refr.

Yes, you are fatal, desirable
There is a word you don't know and that is "faithful"

He was just a clown, in white and red
He was only a clown, but now he's dead
He laughed and jumped into the bright yellow light
But beneath that smile was a sad face

Chorus
The memory remains of that clown with his smile
He has given everything until the last day
Nobody knew the pain of being silent
grief
Because in the end there was no one who he
left

He lived alone, in a wooden wagon
He was just a clown, and that's how he got old
His hat was too small and his shoes too big
He was only a clown, but now he's dead

{Chorus}

One night, he fell, just like every time
The audience laughed loudly, but it was over for him
He was just a clown, in white and red
He was only a clown, but now he's dead

chorus, repeat
He was just a clown
In white and in red
He was just a clown
But now he's dead

He laughed and jumped
In the bright yellow light
But under that smile
Had a sad face

Chorus:
The memory remains
To that clown with his smile
He gave everything
Until the last day
Nobody knew the pain
Of his silent grief
Because there was in the end
No one he left

He lived alone
In a wooden wagon
He was just a clown
And so he grew old

His hat was too small
And his shoes are too big
He was just a clown
But now he's dead

One night, he fell
Just like every time
The audience laughed loudly
But it was over for him



He was just a clown
In white and in red
He was just a clown
But now he's dead. He was just a clown, in white and red
He was only a clown, but now he's dead
He laughed and jumped into the bright yellow light
But beneath that smile was a sad face

The memory remains of that clown with his smile
He has given everything until the last day
Nobody knew the pain of being silent
grief
Because in the end there was no one who he

His hat was too small and his shoes too big
